Continuing. Below is **Step 14**, written to the **same fully scripted, explicit standard**. This step is sensitive because it involves AI; the script makes teacher control and sequencing unambiguous.

# Step 14: Language Questions (AI Chatbot – Workbook First)

> **Critical rule for this step:**
> Students **must write their questions first**.
> The AI is used **only after thinking and writing**.

---

## What teachers project:

![App interface for Step 14: Language Questions chatbot](app step 14.png)

*The AI chatbot interface that teachers use to answer student questions after they have written them in their workbooks.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher addresses the class **before opening the chatbot**.

> “Now we will ask questions about language.”
>
> “These are questions about English, not opinions.”

The teacher gives examples aloud:

> “You can ask about vocabulary.”
>
> “You can ask about sentence meaning.”
>
> “You can ask about grammar.”
>
> “You can also ask cultural questions.”

The teacher gives a concrete example:

> “For example: ‘Why is the school day in America so short?’”

Then the teacher sets a firm boundary:

> “Do **not** talk to the AI yet.”
>
> “First, you must write your question.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Directs students to open the workbook to **Step 12: Language Questions**.
* Points to the question lines on the page.

## What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page: Step 12 - Language Questions](WB 12 - Language Questions.png)

*Students write their language and cultural questions here before the teacher uses the AI chatbot.*

---

* Says:

> "Write one good question."
>
> "If you finish quickly, write a second."

While students are writing, the teacher:

* Walks the room.
* Reads questions quietly.
* Helps students rephrase unclear questions by asking:

  > “What exactly do you want to know?”
* Does **not** correct answers yet.
* Does **not** open the AI interface.

---

## 3. What students do

* Review the article and their work.
* Write one or two language or cultural questions in the workbook.
* Check spelling and clarity.
* Wait quietly after finishing.

Students do **not**:

* Call out questions.
* Use the AI themselves.
* Copy classmates’ questions.

---

## 4. Using the AI (teacher-mediated)

### What the teacher says and does

* Selects a **small number of student questions** based on time and relevance.
* Says:

> “I will type your question exactly as written.”

* Types the first student question into the AI chatbot.
* Projects the AI response.
* Reads the response aloud slowly.
* Pauses and asks:

> “What does this answer mean?”

* Paraphrases or clarifies if necessary.
* Points back to the text or earlier examples when relevant.

The teacher repeats this process for a limited number of questions.

---

## 5. What students do during AI responses

* Listen to the AI response.
* Compare it to their own understanding.
* Write short notes or summaries in the workbook.
* Ask follow-up clarification questions **only if invited**.

---

## 6. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before ending this step, the teacher checks that:

* Students understand that AI is a **support tool**, not a shortcut.
* Students see that **good questions lead to good answers**.
* The class remains focused and not overly excited by the technology.

The teacher closes the step by saying:

> “This is how you use AI to learn language.”
>
> “You think first. Then you ask.”

---

## 7. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why the workbook comes first:**
Without written questions, students treat AI as entertainment or answer-giving. Writing first slows thinking and improves question quality.

Advanced teachers may:

* group similar questions
* compare two AI answers
* revisit unanswered questions in a later lesson

But never allow:

* free AI chat
* unprepared questioning

---

## Final Step: Lesson Summary & Reflection (Workbook)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher signals closure clearly.

> “We are finishing the lesson.”

The teacher adds:

> “Now you will think about your learning.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Lesson Summary** screen briefly.
* Points to indicators such as:

  * completed steps,
  * saved vocabulary,
  * saved sentences,
  * quiz results.
* Says:

> “These show what you practiced today.”

The teacher then directs attention back to the workbook.

> "Open to the last page: Lesson Reflection."

---

## What students see for lesson reflection:

![Workbook page: Step 13 - Lesson Reflection](WB 13 - Lesson Reflection.png)

*The reflection page where students record what they learned, rate their understanding and effort, and note questions.*

---

## 3. What students do

Students complete the reflection section in the workbook:

* Write one thing they learned.
* Rate their understanding.
* Rate their effort.
* Note something interesting.
* Write one remaining question (language or cultural).

Students work quietly and individually.

---

## 4. Homework explanation (optional)

If the teacher chooses to assign homework, they say explicitly:

> “Your homework is written here.”

The teacher points to the homework section and explains which items are required.

If the school uses guardian signatures, the teacher says:

> “Ask a guardian to sign here.”

If not, the teacher says:

> “You do not need a signature.”

---

## 5. What the teacher checks before dismissal

Before ending the lesson, the teacher checks that:

* Students have completed the reflection.
* Homework expectations are clear.
* Materials are packed away.

The teacher closes with:

> “Next time, you will use the app more independently.”

---

## Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why reflection matters:**
This step trains students to connect effort, strategy, and outcome. Over time, it builds learner independence.

Advanced teachers may:

* briefly discuss reflections
* track patterns across lessons

But avoid turning reflection into discussion every time.
Its power is in **routine and honesty**, not performance.

This completes the **fully scripted teacher-led Reading Advantage lesson**, written for novice implementation with optional expert insight.

If you want, the next productive step would be:

* a **teacher-facing quick-reference script**, or
* a **trainer’s guide explaining why each step exists**, or
* a **Primary Advantage adaptation**.
