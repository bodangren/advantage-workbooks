Continuing. Below is **Step 4**, written at the **same scripted, explicit, novice-safe level** as Steps 1–3. I am deliberately slowing the instructional flow and describing **exact teacher behavior**, not summarizing.

# Step 4: Collect Vocabulary (Choosing Words to Study Later)

---

## What teachers project on screen:

---

## 1. What the teacher says

After the first reading ends, the teacher addresses the class **before clicking anything**.

> “Now we will choose vocabulary.”
>
> “This is very important.”

The teacher pauses, then explains the purpose clearly:

> “We do **not** save every new word.”
>
> “We only save words that are useful to study again.”

The teacher continues:

> “When you read alone in the app, you will do this by yourself.”
>
> “Today, we practice together.”

The teacher points to the screen.

> “I will show you how to choose.”

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Collect Vocabulary** screen so the word list is clearly visible.
* Points to the **first word** in the list.
* Thinks aloud while pointing, saying for example:

> “I will save this word.”
>
> “I see it more than one time.”
>
> “It helps me understand the text.”

* Clicks the **save / bookmark icon** next to the word.
* Points to another word and says:

> “I will not save this one.”
>
> “It is interesting, but I do not need it now.”

* Clicks nothing for that word.

After modeling two or three words, the teacher gives the rule:

> “You must save **at least five words**.”
>
> “The lesson will not continue if you save fewer than five.”

The teacher then instructs:

> “Now you choose.”

While students are working, the teacher:

* Walks slowly around the room.
* Looks at student screens (if visible) or observes cursor movement on the projected screen.
* Answers questions quietly if a student raises a hand.
* Does **not** tell students which words to choose unless they are stuck.
* Does **not** explain grammar or usage here.

## 3. What students do

* Look at the vocabulary list on the screen.
* Decide which words are:

  * difficult,
  * important for understanding,
  * or useful in other texts.
* Click to save **at least five words** in the app.
* Open the workbook to **Step 4**.
* Write:

  * the selected words, and
  * the paragraph number where each word appears.

Students may choose **different words** from each other.

### What students see in their workbook:

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing, the teacher checks that:

* The app shows **five or more saved words**.
* Students are not repeatedly asking “Which word?”
* Most students have written something in the workbook.

If many students have chosen randomly, the teacher pauses and says:

> “Remember, choose words you want to study again later.”

Only then does the teacher proceed.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step matters:**
This is the first moment where students are asked to **make a learning decision**, not just follow instructions.

Resist the urge to:

* correct choices,
* enforce the same words for everyone,
* overexplain meaning.

The habit you are building is:

> *“I choose what is worth my effort.”*

That habit transfers directly to independent reading later.

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 5: In-Depth Reading**, maintaining the same level of explicit scripting.
