Continuing. Below is **Step 5**, written at the **same fully scripted, action-by-action level** as the previous steps. This is a **deliberate shift** in the lesson, so the teacher’s language and control matter.

# Step 5: In-Depth Reading (Reading Again with Control and Accuracy)

---

**What teachers project:**

![App interface for Step 5 - In-Depth Reading](app step 5.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher addresses the class **before starting the second reading**.

> “We will read the article again.”
>
> “This time is different.”

The teacher explains the purpose clearly:

> “The first time, we listened for general meaning.”
>
> “This time, we read more carefully.”

The teacher gives a clear physical instruction:

> “Put your finger on the screen.”
>
> “Follow the words as we read.”

If the teacher plans to use oral reading, they add:

> “Sometimes I will stop.”
>
> “Sometimes you will read.”
>
> “Be ready.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

The teacher chooses **one structure** based on the class. The structure should be announced clearly and followed consistently.

---

### Option A: Audio + Finger Tracking (Most Classes)

* Starts the audio again (same speed or slightly faster if appropriate).
* Watches students’ hands and eyes.
* Stops the audio **only at paragraph breaks**.
* At each pause, says:

> “Stop.”
>
> “What is the main idea of this paragraph?”

* Waits briefly.
* Allows students to write before continuing.

---

### Option B: Whole-Class Round-Robin Reading

* Turns audio **off**.
* Points to the first sentence.
* Says one student’s name and gestures to read.
* After each sentence:

  * points to the next sentence,
  * calls a **different student**, without a pattern.
* Stops after each paragraph and gives the same instruction:

> “Write the main idea of this paragraph.”

---

### Option C: Small-Group Round-Robin Reading (More Regulated Classes)

* Divides the class into small groups (3–4 students).
* Says clearly:

> “Take turns reading one sentence each.”
>
> “When the paragraph finishes, stop and write.”

* Walks between groups.
* Listens for pronunciation and attention.
* Redirects quietly if groups go off task.

---

## 3. What students do

Depending on the structure chosen, students:

* Read the article **a second time**.
* Track the text with a finger while listening or reading.
* Read aloud when called on.
* Stop at paragraph breaks.
* Open the workbook to **Step 5**.
* Write **one short main idea** for each paragraph.

**What students see in their workbooks:**

![Workbook page for Step 5 - Deep Reading Notes](WB 5 - deep reading notes.png)

Students do **not**:

* Copy full sentences from the text.
* Discuss opinions.
* Ask vocabulary questions at this stage.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing to the next step, the teacher checks that:

* Each paragraph has been read carefully.
* Most students have written **something** for each paragraph.
* Students are generally identifying meaning, not copying text.

If students are copying, the teacher stops and says:

> “Do not copy.”
>
> “Use your own simple words.”

Only after this correction does the teacher continue.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step is critical:**
This is where reading shifts from *exposure* to *control*.

Finger tracking, unpredictable reader changes, and paragraph pauses all serve one purpose:

> to force attention onto meaning, not speed.

Advanced teachers may:

* increase oral reading
* reduce audio support
* ask slightly more probing main-idea prompts

But for novice teachers, the rule is:

> Slow down. Control the text. Do not rush.
