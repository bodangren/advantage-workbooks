# Preface

## Welcome to Reading Advantage

Welcome to the Reading Advantage Teacher's Manual. This guide has been designed to support you in delivering high-quality, scaffolded English reading instruction to your secondary students using the Reading Advantage workbook system.

---

## What is Reading Advantage?

Reading Advantage is a comprehensive English language learning program that combines digital extensive reading with structured print workbooks. The program serves secondary EFL/ESL students across CEFR levels A1 through C1 (Reading Advantage Levels 1–15), with content specifically designed for Thai learners in grades 7–12.

At its core, Reading Advantage believes that **reading ability develops through guided practice with appropriate texts**, supported by explicit instruction in vocabulary, comprehension strategies, and language awareness.

## The Role of Workbooks

The Reading Advantage workbooks serve as your students' primary tool for:

* **Active engagement** with reading texts through structured note-taking and reflection
* **Vocabulary development** with intentional word selection and practice
* **Comprehension practice** through evidence-based questioning
* **Writing development** with scaffolded prompts and sentence practice
* **Metacognitive awareness** by tracking their own learning process

Each workbook is designed to work **in tandem with the Reading Advantage digital platform**, not as a replacement. Students interact with the app (for audio, translations, vocabulary saving, and AI support) while recording their thinking and responses in the workbook.

This dual-mode approach ensures that:
- Digital tools provide support (audio, definitions, instant feedback)
- Physical writing promotes deeper processing and retention
- Teachers can monitor student thinking through workbook annotations

## Who This Manual is For

This manual is designed for:

* **Classroom teachers** delivering Reading Advantage lessons in whole-class, teacher-led settings
* **New teachers** who need explicit, step-by-step guidance on effective reading instruction
* **Experienced teachers** looking to implement a consistent, research-based reading routine
* **Academic coaches and trainers** preparing teachers to use Reading Advantage with fidelity

You do not need prior experience with Reading Advantage, extensive reading programs, or advanced technology skills. Everything you need to know is explained in this manual.

## How This Manual is Organized

This manual contains five sections, designed to be used at different stages of your preparation and teaching:

### 1. Quick Reference (One-Page Script)
A condensed guide for **live teaching**. Use this once you're familiar with the lesson structure and need a quick reminder of the "Say/Do/Check" routine for each step.

### 2. Complete Teacher-Led Lesson Plan
A **comprehensive walkthrough** of a full 60–90 minute lesson. This section explains:
- What to do at each step
- Why each step matters pedagogically
- What students should be doing
- How to monitor student engagement

**Read this section carefully before your first lesson.**

### 3. Step-by-Step Detailed Descriptions
**In-depth guidance** for each of the 14 lesson steps, with:
- Detailed teacher scripts and prompts
- Common student responses and misconceptions
- Troubleshooting tips
- Visual references (screenshots)

Use this section when you need **extra clarity** on a specific step or want to improve your delivery of a particular routine.

### 4. Trainer's Guide
Designed for **coaches, mentors, and lead teachers** who are training others to deliver Reading Advantage lessons. This section covers:
- How to model the lesson for teachers
- What to emphasize during training
- How to observe and coach for fidelity
- Common implementation pitfalls and how to address them

If you are learning to teach Reading Advantage on your own, you can skip this section initially and return to it later if you become a mentor to others.

## Our Pedagogical Approach

Reading Advantage is built on three core instructional principles:

### 1. **Explicit Modeling**
We do not assume students know how to read strategically, select vocabulary, or self-assess. Every skill is **modeled explicitly** before students practice independently.

### 2. **Gradual Release of Responsibility**
Lessons move from teacher-led (Steps 1–3) to collaborative (Steps 4–8) to independent practice (Steps 9–14). This ensures students develop the habits needed for autonomous reading.

### 3. **Evidence-Based Comprehension**
We train students to justify their answers using text evidence, not guessing or relying on background knowledge alone. This builds critical reading skills essential for academic success.

---

## What Makes This Approach Different

If you have taught reading before, you may notice that Reading Advantage lessons:

* **Move more slowly** through texts (rereading is intentional, not remedial)
* **Prioritize student selection** over teacher correction (vocabulary and sentence choices are metacognitive, not accuracy tasks)
* **Use class answers, not teacher answers** in comprehension activities (to keep students accountable)
* **Limit teacher explanation** in favor of structured practice and repetition
* **Integrate AI support carefully** (students must think first, ask second)

These are deliberate design choices based on research in second language reading development. Trust the process, even when it feels slower than you're used to.

---

## How to Use This Manual

### If you are teaching your first Reading Advantage lesson:
1. Read the **Complete Teacher-Led Lesson Plan** (Section 2) in full
2. Review the **Step-by-Step Detailed Descriptions** (Section 3) for any steps that feel unclear
3. Prepare your materials (workbooks, projector, audio check)
4. Keep the **Quick Reference** (Section 1) nearby during live teaching
5. After your first lesson, reflect on what went well and what needs adjustment

### If you are an experienced Reading Advantage teacher:
1. Use the **Quick Reference** during lessons
2. Refer to **Step-by-Step Descriptions** when you want to refine specific routines
3. Review the **Trainer's Guide** (Section 4) if you are supporting other teachers

### If you are training other teachers:
1. Start with the **Trainer's Guide** (Section 4) to understand the training approach
2. Model the lesson yourself using the **Complete Plan** (Section 2)
3. Use the **Step-by-Step Descriptions** (Section 3) during rehearsals and debrief sessions

## What You Will Need

To teach Reading Advantage lessons effectively, ensure you have:

* **Projector or large screen** capable of displaying the Reading Advantage app to the whole class
* **Audio capability** (speakers) for playing article audio clearly
* **Student workbooks** (one per student, printed and ready)
* **Reliable internet connection** for accessing the Reading Advantage platform
* **Student accounts** set up in advance with appropriate reading levels assigned

Optional but helpful:
* Document camera for showing student work
* Timer visible to students
* Pointer or laser for directing attention to text

## A Note on Pacing and Flexibility

The lesson plan in this manual describes a **full 60–90 minute lesson**. This is ideal for deep learning and habit formation.

However, we understand that class periods vary. If you have less time:
- **45-minute version:** Omit or shorten Steps 9–12 (vocabulary and sentence practice can be assigned as homework or done in a future lesson)
- **30-minute version:** Focus on Steps 1–8 only (orientation, reading, and comprehension), and assign practice steps as independent work

**What you should never skip:**
- Step 3 (First Reading with Audio) — this is essential for building fluency and confidence
- Step 7 (Evidence-based comprehension) — this is the core of critical reading instruction

Adjust practice and production steps as needed, but **protect the core reading experience**.

## Final Thoughts

Teaching reading well is one of the most important things you will do for your students. Reading ability is the foundation for all academic learning, critical thinking, and lifelong growth.

The Reading Advantage system is designed to make effective reading instruction **manageable, consistent, and impactful**—even if you are new to teaching or working with large classes.

This manual will guide you step by step. Trust the structure. Model the routines. Give students time to think and practice. You will see growth.

Thank you for your commitment to your students' learning. We are honored to support your work.
