Continuing. Below is **Step 13**, written at the **same fully scripted, novice-safe level**. This step is intentionally different in nature, and the script makes that difference explicit so teachers do not try to “run it like the app.”

# Step 13: Writing Practice (Workbook Only – Long Answer)

> **Important framing for the teacher:**
> This step is **not led through the app**. It is a **quiet, sustained writing task** designed to prepare students for later AI-supported writing at home or in another session.

---

## What teachers project on screen:

![App interface for Step 13 - Writing Practice](app step 13.png)

*The app shows Step 13 with the title "Writing Practice" and instructions for this offline writing activity.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher stands at the front, holding the workbook or pointing to the projected image of the page.

> “Now we will write.”
>
> “This is your own writing.”

The teacher clarifies expectations immediately:

> “This is not copying.”
>
> “This is not a test.”

The teacher adds reassurance:

> “You will plan first.”
>
> “Then you will write.”

The teacher then explains level expectations carefully:

> “How much you write depends on your level.”
>
> “Follow the advice in the workbook.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Directs students to open the workbook to **Step 11: Writing Practice**.

## What students see in their workbooks:

![Workbook page - Step 11: Writing Practice](WB 11 Writing practice.png)

*The workbook page shows planning boxes (main idea, key details, vocabulary to use, reason/explanation), writing space, and a self-check list at the bottom.*

---

* Points to the **planning boxes** and names them one by one:

  * Main idea
  * Key details
  * Vocabulary to use
  * Reason / explanation
* Says:

> “Do not start writing sentences yet.”
>
> “Plan first.”

The teacher models planning briefly by:

* Writing one example word or phrase on the board (not a full sentence).
* Saying:

> “This is planning, not writing.”

The teacher then sets the writing condition:

> “You will write quietly.”
>
> “I will not correct sentences now.”

While students are writing, the teacher:

* Walks slowly around the room.
* Looks for:

  * students planning before drafting,
  * students actually writing,
  * students stuck and not starting.
* Encourages quietly:

  > “Start with your main idea.”
  > “Check your vocabulary list.”

The teacher does **not**:

* dictate sentences,
* correct grammar line by line,
* allow students to copy from the screen.

---

## 3. What students do

* Open the workbook to the writing page.
* Complete the planning boxes first.
* Write a **first draft** based on their plan.
* Use vocabulary from the lesson (at least 3 words, as indicated).
* Organize ideas into clear sentences or paragraphs, appropriate to level.
* Complete the self-check at the bottom of the page:

  * vocabulary use,
  * organization,
  * spelling check,
  * word count.

Students work **individually and quietly**.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before ending this step, the teacher checks that:

* Every student has written **something**, even if short.
* Planning boxes are completed, not skipped.
* Students have attempted the self-check honestly.

If students have written very little, the teacher says calmly:

> “This is a first draft.”
>
> “It does not need to be perfect.”

---

## 5. Connection to the app (explained, not performed)

Before moving to the next step, the teacher explains clearly:

> “Later, you will type this writing into the app.”
>
> “The app will give you feedback.”
>
> “You will improve your writing and submit again.”

The teacher emphasizes:

> “That happens **after** class, not now.”

---

## 6. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step stays offline first:**
Writing quality improves when students **think before typing**. The workbook forces planning and reflection that many students skip in digital spaces.

Advanced teachers may:

* allow peer sharing after drafting
* extend writing length at higher levels

But do not remove:

* the planning stage
* the self-check list

Those are what make the later AI feedback meaningful.
