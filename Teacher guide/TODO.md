## Questions to Resolve

1. **Image Placement:** Should app and workbook images be:
   - Side-by-side (landscape orientation)?
   - Stacked vertically (app on top, workbook below)?
   - Alternating in the text flow?

2. **Image Size:** What dimensions work best for PDF output?
   - Full page?
   - Half page?
   - Inline with text wrap?

3. **Additional Content Needed:**
   - Do we need a table of contents?
   - Should we add an index?
   - Any appendices (glossary, troubleshooting, FAQs)?

4. **PDF Styling:**
   - Should we add headers/footers?
   - Page numbers?
   - Branding/logo?

---

## Notes

- All markdown files use relative image paths
- Final PDF should be print-ready (high resolution images)
- Consider creating both a full-color version and a grayscale/printer-friendly version
- Manual should be self-contained (no external dependencies)

---

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Read through all step files to understand existing content structure
2. Create image integration plan based on step file content
3. Begin integrating images into step-by-step section
4. Test PDF conversion with sample content
