Understood. Continuing at the **same scripted, explicit level**, with no compression and no assumed expertise.

Below is **Step 3**, written as a **true instructional script** for novice teachers.

# Step 3: First Reading with Audio (Listening for Overall Meaning)

---

## What teachers project on the screen:

![App interface showing the First Reading with Audio screen](app step 3.png)

The app displays the article with controls for audio playback, speed adjustment, and sentence highlighting. Students will see each sentence highlighted as the audio plays.

---

## What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page for Step 3 - Read the Article](WB 3 - Read the article.png)

Students have the article text in their workbooks with a QR code to access the interactive version. The workbook shows the same article they will hear read aloud.

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher faces the class and speaks **before touching the controls**.

> “Now we will listen to the article.”
>
> “This is the first reading.”

The teacher pauses, then gives a clear rule:

> “Do not read aloud.”
>
> “Do not stop me.”
>
> “Just listen and follow with your eyes.”

The teacher points to the screen.

> “The computer will highlight each sentence.”
>
> “Your job is to watch the words and listen.”

Before starting, the teacher adds:

> “If you do not understand everything, that is okay.”
>
> “We will read again later.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Sets the audio speed to **0.75×**.
* Confirms that **sentence highlighting is ON**.
* Places one hand on the mouse or keyboard to prevent accidental pauses.
* Starts the audio.
* Stays silent while the audio plays.
* Watches the class while listening:

  * checks that eyes are on the screen,
  * notices students who look lost or distracted.
* Does **not**:

  * translate,
  * explain vocabulary,
  * answer questions,
  * stop the audio mid-sentence.

If a technical issue occurs (audio stops or skips), the teacher:

* calmly restarts from the beginning of the sentence,
* resumes without comment.

---

## 3. What students do

* Sit facing the screen.
* Watch as each sentence is highlighted.
* Listen to the audio.
* Follow the text silently.
* Do not speak.
* Do not write.
* Do not ask questions during playback.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

When the audio finishes, the teacher checks that:

* The entire article has played from start to finish.
* Students remained silent and attentive.
* Most students were visually tracking the text.

The teacher does **not** ask comprehension questions yet.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step must stay uninterrupted:**
Many teachers instinctively stop to explain vocabulary. Doing so here weakens the purpose of the first reading.

This step is about:

* rhythm,
* flow,
* overall meaning.

Understanding **comes later**.

If students appear confused, that is expected.
Confusion at this stage means the step is working.

> First reading = exposure, not mastery.

When you are ready, I will continue with **Step 4: Collect Vocabulary**, written at the same level of explicitness.
