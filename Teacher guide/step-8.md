Continuing. Below is **Step 8**, written at the **same scripted, explicit, novice-safe level** as the previous steps. This step is deliberately slower and more deliberate because it **models how students should answer and evaluate short answers in the app later**.

# Step 8: Short Answer Questions (Modeling How to Answer and Self-Evaluate)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

Before showing the question, the teacher addresses the class.

> “Now we will answer a short question.”
>
> “This answer is longer than multiple choice.”

The teacher adds an important clarification:

> “The question on the screen may be different from the workbook.”
>
> “That is okay. They check the same reading skill.”

The teacher then explains the process clearly:

> “First, we will answer **together**.”
>
> “I will type the class answer.”
>
> “Later, you will write your own answer in the workbook.”

---

### What teachers project on screen:

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Short Answer Question** screen.
* Points to the question and reads it aloud once.
* Says:

> “Read the question again quietly.”

* Waits while students reread.

The teacher then introduces the rubric **before answering**:

* Points to the four criteria on the screen and says, one by one:

  * “Answer the question.”
  * “Use information from the article.”
  * “Give a reason or explanation.”
  * “Write in complete sentences.”

The teacher says:

> “We will try to do all four.”

---

## 3. Collaborative class answer (modeling phase)

### What the teacher says and does

1. Says:

> “Think about your answer.”

2. Waits briefly.
3. Says:

> “Turn to your partner and talk.”

4. Walks around and listens.
5. Raises a hand and says:

> “Stop. Look at me.”

6. Asks:

> “What should we say first?”

7. Elicits a short response from a student.
8. Types that idea into the app.
9. Asks:

> “What detail from the article supports this?”

10. Adds a supporting sentence.
11. Asks:

> “Do we have a reason or explanation?”

12. Adds a simple reason.
13. Reads the full answer aloud as typed.

---

## 4. Submitting and evaluating the class answer

### What the teacher does

* Clicks **Submit**.
* Displays the **model answer** provided by the app.
* Points back and forth between:

  * the class answer, and
  * the model answer.

The teacher asks the class:

> “Did we answer the question?”
> “Did we use the article?”
> “Did we give a reason?”
> “Are these complete sentences?”

For each “yes,” the teacher gestures and counts aloud.

The teacher then says:

> “Now we give ourselves stars.”

* Selects **1–5 stars** in the app based on the discussion.
* Explains briefly why that rating was chosen.

---

## 5. Individual workbook writing

### What the teacher says

> "Now you will write your own answer."

The teacher gives clear instructions:

> "Open your workbook to Step 8."
>
> "Write your own short answer."
>
> "Use the rubric to check yourself."

### What students see in their workbook:

---

## 6. What students do

* Participate in partner discussion.
* Watch how the teacher builds the class answer.
* Observe how the rubric is applied.
* Write their **own short answer** in the workbook.
* Check the rubric boxes honestly.
* Do not copy the class answer word for word.

---

## 7. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before leaving this step, the teacher checks that:

* Students are writing, not waiting.
* Most answers include:

  * a clear response, and
  * at least one supporting idea.
* Students have engaged with the rubric.

If many students are copying, the teacher says:

> “Your answer can be different.”
>
> “That is okay.”

---

## 8. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step is done together first:**
Students often fail short answers because they do not understand what a *good answer looks like*.

By building one answer together, you are making expectations visible.

Advanced teachers may:

* reduce the length of the modeled answer
* ask students to suggest rubric scores themselves

But do not skip:

* showing the model answer, or
* discussing the rubric.

Those are what make this step transferable to independent app use.
