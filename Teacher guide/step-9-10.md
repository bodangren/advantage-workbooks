Continuing. Below are **Steps 9–10**, written as **one combined scripted instructional block**, at the **same explicit, novice-safe level** as previous steps. I am intentionally over-describing teacher behavior because this is where many teachers either rush or “hand the app back to itself.”

# Steps 9–10: Vocabulary Practice

*(Reviewing and Strengthening Saved Vocabulary)*

> **Important orientation for the teacher:**
> In the app these are two steps, but in teaching they function as **one continuous practice cycle**. Do not treat them as separate lessons.

---

## Step 9 (App): Vocabulary Flashcards

**What teachers project for Step 9:**

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher pauses before starting the activity and addresses the class.

> “Now we will practice the vocabulary you chose.”
>
> “These are **your words**, not my words.”

The teacher adds a key modeling statement:

> “This is exactly how you should practice vocabulary when you use the app by yourself.”

The teacher points to the flashcard interface.

> “First, listen.”
>
> “Then, say the word.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each flashcard**, the teacher follows the same routine:

1. Clicks **Play Audio**.
2. Faces the class and gestures clearly.
3. Says:

> “Everyone.”

4. Listens to the class repeat chorally.
5. Immediately says one student’s name:

> “[Student name], again.”

6. Clicks **Show Answer**.
7. Briefly points to the meaning (English and Thai).
8. Moves directly to the next card.

While doing this, the teacher:

* Keeps the pace steady.
* Does not stop to explain usage.
* Does not quiz individual students.
* Does not correct minor pronunciation errors unless they block understanding.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the flashcard on the screen.
* Listen to the audio.
* Repeat the word together.
* Repeat individually if called on.
* Mentally check whether they remembered the meaning before it appeared.

Students do **not**:

* Write during this step.
* Ask for spelling.
* Turn this into a discussion.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before advancing to the next activity, the teacher checks that:

* All saved words have been reviewed once.
* Choral repetition is audible and engaged.
* Individual students can repeat when called on.

If repetition is weak, the teacher repeats **one or two cards only**, then moves on.

---

## Step 10 (App): Vocabulary Matching Game

**What teachers project for Step 10:**

![Vocabulary matching game interface with words and definitions to match](app step 10.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher transitions explicitly.

> “Now we will play a matching game.”
>
> “This is still vocabulary practice.”

The teacher explains expectations:

> “Before we match, we say the word.”
>
> “We do not guess.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

The teacher chooses **one mode** and states it clearly.

### Option A: Whole-Class Mode

* Keeps control of the mouse.
* Points to a word and asks:

> “Which meaning matches?”

* Listens to responses.
* Clicks the class’s agreed match.
* If incorrect, says calmly:

> “That one does not match. Let’s try again.”

### Option B: Student-at-the-Board Mode

* Invites one student to come to the computer.
* Says:

> “Say the word first.”

* Allows the student to make the match.
* Confirms or redirects gently.
* Rotates students if time and management allow.

The teacher keeps the tone **low-stakes and focused**, not competitive.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the words and meanings.
* Say words aloud before matching.
* Suggest matches verbally.
* Watch corrections and adjust understanding.

Students do **not**:

* Shout answers.
* Treat mistakes as failure.
* Rush the activity.

---

## 4. Workbook follow-up (Workbook Step 9)

After both app activities, the teacher directs students clearly.

> "Now open your workbook to Step 9."

**What students see in their workbook:**

![Workbook page showing vocabulary matching and cloze exercises](WB 9 vocabulary practice.png)

### What the teacher does

* Points to the matching activity.
* Says:

> “Do this first.”

* Then points to the cloze activity.
* Says:

> “Do this next.”

* Circulates quietly while students work.
* Does not give answers immediately.

### What students do

* Complete the matching exercise.
* Complete the cloze (fill-in-the-blank) exercise.
* Work independently or quietly with a partner, as directed.

---

## 5. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before leaving this block, the teacher:

* Asks students to **check their answers**.
* Says:

> “Show me how many you got correct.”

* Observes finger responses.
* Notes common problems but does not re-teach extensively.

---

## 6. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step matters:**
This is where vocabulary moves from *recognition* to *retrieval*.

The sequence is intentional:

1. Hear → say → see meaning
2. Choose → confirm → adjust
3. Apply independently in print

Advanced teachers may:

* shorten flashcards once routines are strong
* allow faster student-led matching

But do not remove:

* choral repetition
* saying the word before matching

Those are the anchors for weaker readers.

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Steps 11–12: Sentence Practice**, written at the same level of scripting and control.
