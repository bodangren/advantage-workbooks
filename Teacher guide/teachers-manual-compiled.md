# Preface

## Welcome to Reading Advantage

Welcome to the Reading Advantage Teacher's Manual. This guide has been designed to support you in delivering high-quality, scaffolded English reading instruction to your secondary students using the Reading Advantage workbook system.

---

## What is Reading Advantage?

Reading Advantage is a comprehensive English language learning program that combines digital extensive reading with structured print workbooks. The program serves secondary EFL/ESL students across CEFR levels A1 through C1 (Reading Advantage Levels 1–15), with content specifically designed for Thai learners in grades 7–12.

At its core, Reading Advantage believes that **reading ability develops through guided practice with appropriate texts**, supported by explicit instruction in vocabulary, comprehension strategies, and language awareness.

---

## The Role of Workbooks

The Reading Advantage workbooks serve as your students' primary tool for:

* **Active engagement** with reading texts through structured note-taking and reflection
* **Vocabulary development** with intentional word selection and practice
* **Comprehension practice** through evidence-based questioning
* **Writing development** with scaffolded prompts and sentence practice
* **Metacognitive awareness** by tracking their own learning process

Each workbook is designed to work **in tandem with the Reading Advantage digital platform**, not as a replacement. Students interact with the app (for audio, translations, vocabulary saving, and AI support) while recording their thinking and responses in the workbook.

This dual-mode approach ensures that:
- Digital tools provide support (audio, definitions, instant feedback)
- Physical writing promotes deeper processing and retention
- Teachers can monitor student thinking through workbook annotations

---

## Who This Manual is For

This manual is designed for:

* **Classroom teachers** delivering Reading Advantage lessons in whole-class, teacher-led settings
* **New teachers** who need explicit, step-by-step guidance on effective reading instruction
* **Experienced teachers** looking to implement a consistent, research-based reading routine
* **Academic coaches and trainers** preparing teachers to use Reading Advantage with fidelity

You do not need prior experience with Reading Advantage, extensive reading programs, or advanced technology skills. Everything you need to know is explained in this manual.

---

## How This Manual is Organized

This manual contains five sections, designed to be used at different stages of your preparation and teaching:

### 1. Quick Reference (One-Page Script)
A condensed guide for **live teaching**. Use this once you're familiar with the lesson structure and need a quick reminder of the "Say/Do/Check" routine for each step.

### 2. Complete Teacher-Led Lesson Plan
A **comprehensive walkthrough** of a full 60–90 minute lesson. This section explains:
- What to do at each step
- Why each step matters pedagogically
- What students should be doing
- How to monitor student engagement

**Read this section carefully before your first lesson.**

### 3. Step-by-Step Detailed Descriptions
**In-depth guidance** for each of the 14 lesson steps, with:
- Detailed teacher scripts and prompts
- Common student responses and misconceptions
- Troubleshooting tips
- Visual references (screenshots)

Use this section when you need **extra clarity** on a specific step or want to improve your delivery of a particular routine.

### 4. Trainer's Guide
Designed for **coaches, mentors, and lead teachers** who are training others to deliver Reading Advantage lessons. This section covers:
- How to model the lesson for teachers
- What to emphasize during training
- How to observe and coach for fidelity
- Common implementation pitfalls and how to address them

If you are learning to teach Reading Advantage on your own, you can skip this section initially and return to it later if you become a mentor to others.

---

## Our Pedagogical Approach

Reading Advantage is built on three core instructional principles:

### 1. **Explicit Modeling**
We do not assume students know how to read strategically, select vocabulary, or self-assess. Every skill is **modeled explicitly** before students practice independently.

### 2. **Gradual Release of Responsibility**
Lessons move from teacher-led (Steps 1–3) to collaborative (Steps 4–8) to independent practice (Steps 9–14). This ensures students develop the habits needed for autonomous reading.

### 3. **Evidence-Based Comprehension**
We train students to justify their answers using text evidence, not guessing or relying on background knowledge alone. This builds critical reading skills essential for academic success.

---

## What Makes This Approach Different

If you have taught reading before, you may notice that Reading Advantage lessons:

* **Move more slowly** through texts (rereading is intentional, not remedial)
* **Prioritize student selection** over teacher correction (vocabulary and sentence choices are metacognitive, not accuracy tasks)
* **Use class answers, not teacher answers** in comprehension activities (to keep students accountable)
* **Limit teacher explanation** in favor of structured practice and repetition
* **Integrate AI support carefully** (students must think first, ask second)

These are deliberate design choices based on research in second language reading development. Trust the process, even when it feels slower than you're used to.

---

## How to Use This Manual

### If you are teaching your first Reading Advantage lesson:
1. Read the **Complete Teacher-Led Lesson Plan** (Section 2) in full
2. Review the **Step-by-Step Detailed Descriptions** (Section 3) for any steps that feel unclear
3. Prepare your materials (workbooks, projector, audio check)
4. Keep the **Quick Reference** (Section 1) nearby during live teaching
5. After your first lesson, reflect on what went well and what needs adjustment

### If you are an experienced Reading Advantage teacher:
1. Use the **Quick Reference** during lessons
2. Refer to **Step-by-Step Descriptions** when you want to refine specific routines
3. Review the **Trainer's Guide** (Section 4) if you are supporting other teachers

### If you are training other teachers:
1. Start with the **Trainer's Guide** (Section 4) to understand the training approach
2. Model the lesson yourself using the **Complete Plan** (Section 2)
3. Use the **Step-by-Step Descriptions** (Section 3) during rehearsals and debrief sessions

---

## What You Will Need

To teach Reading Advantage lessons effectively, ensure you have:

* **Projector or large screen** capable of displaying the Reading Advantage app to the whole class
* **Audio capability** (speakers) for playing article audio clearly
* **Student workbooks** (one per student, printed and ready)
* **Reliable internet connection** for accessing the Reading Advantage platform
* **Student accounts** set up in advance with appropriate reading levels assigned

Optional but helpful:
* Document camera for showing student work
* Timer visible to students
* Pointer or laser for directing attention to text

---

## A Note on Pacing and Flexibility

The lesson plan in this manual describes a **full 60–90 minute lesson**. This is ideal for deep learning and habit formation.

However, we understand that class periods vary. If you have less time:
- **45-minute version:** Omit or shorten Steps 9–12 (vocabulary and sentence practice can be assigned as homework or done in a future lesson)
- **30-minute version:** Focus on Steps 1–8 only (orientation, reading, and comprehension), and assign practice steps as independent work

**What you should never skip:**
- Step 3 (First Reading with Audio) — this is essential for building fluency and confidence
- Step 7 (Evidence-based comprehension) — this is the core of critical reading instruction

Adjust practice and production steps as needed, but **protect the core reading experience**.

---

## Final Thoughts

Teaching reading well is one of the most important things you will do for your students. Reading ability is the foundation for all academic learning, critical thinking, and lifelong growth.

The Reading Advantage system is designed to make effective reading instruction **manageable, consistent, and impactful**—even if you are new to teaching or working with large classes.

This manual will guide you step by step. Trust the structure. Model the routines. Give students time to think and practice. You will see growth.

Thank you for your commitment to your students' learning. We are honored to support your work.

## Final Teacher Message

> "This is exactly how you should use Reading Advantage by yourself."

---

**End of Lesson**
Good. Starting with **Step 1** is exactly right.
Below is **Step 1 rewritten correctly**, as a **scripted lesson segment**, with **explicit teacher language and actions**, and **optional coaching notes clearly separated**.

I am deliberately **not** compressing anything. This is the level I will maintain if you approve it.

---

# Step 1: Introduction (Interest & Orientation)

---

## What teachers project on screen:

![App screenshot showing the introduction screen with title, image, and star rating](app step 1.png)

## What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page showing Before You Read section with star rating](WB 1 - before you read.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher stands where all students can see the projected screen.

> “Everyone, look at the screen.”
>
> “This is today’s article. I will read the title first.”

The teacher reads the title **slowly and clearly**, once.

> “Now, look at the picture.”
>
> “Do not read yet. Just look.”

The teacher pauses briefly to allow students to visually process the image.

> “Before we read, we always think about our interest.”
>
> “This is not a test. There is no correct answer.”

The teacher points to the star rating on the screen.

> “In your workbook, you will see the same stars.”
>
> “Please show how interested you are in this topic.”

The teacher adds:

> “You can choose one star, three stars, or five stars. Any answer is okay.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Introduction** screen so the title, image, and star rating are clearly visible.
* Points physically (or with cursor) to:

  * the title
  * the image
  * the star rating
* Walks slowly around the room while students are marking their stars.
* Looks down at desks to confirm students are actually writing, not waiting.
* Does **not** comment on individual choices.
* Does **not** explain the topic yet.
* Stops only when every student has marked a rating.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the projected title.
* Look at the image.
* Open their workbook to **Step 1**.
* Circle or mark **one interest rating** using the stars.
* Do not discuss answers with classmates.
* Do not ask content questions yet.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

The teacher visually confirms that:

* Every student has **marked one star rating** in the workbook.
* No students are still looking around or waiting for direction.
* The room is settled and focused on the task.

Only after this does the teacher continue to the next step.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this matters:**
This step is not about motivation in a general sense. It is about **training students into a routine**:
*every screen requires an action.*

Do **not**:

* ask students to explain their rating
* praise “high interest”
* joke about “low interest”

Doing so turns this into a discussion step, which it is not.

Advanced teachers may later:

* briefly reference these ratings during reflection
* notice patterns over time (without commenting publicly)

But for novice teachers, the rule is simple:

> **Interest is private. Action is required. Move on.**

---

### Stop point

This is the **baseline quality and density** I will maintain for every step if you confirm.

Please answer **one word** or a short sentence:

* “Yes, this is the level — continue.”
* or “Still too thin / too much / wrong tone — adjust like this: ___.”

Once you approve Step 1, I will proceed to **Step 2** without changing the standard.

Understood. I will **continue at the same level**, without compression, and without assuming expertise.

Below is **Step 2**, written to the **same scripted, novice-safe standard** as Step 1.

---

# Step 2: Preview Vocabulary (Pronunciation, Meaning, and Attention)

---

## What teachers project on screen:

![App interface showing Preview Vocabulary phase](app step 2.png)

*The app displays vocabulary words with audio playback buttons, definitions, and progress tracking. Teachers use this projected screen to guide the class through pronunciation and meaning.*

---

## What students see in their workbooks:

![Workbook page showing key vocabulary table](WB 2 - key vocabulary.png)

*Students have a table with columns for: Word, Know it? (checkbox), Definition, and My Translation/Notes. They mark familiar words and add Thai translations or notes for new words.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher remains at the front, facing the class and the projected screen.

> “Now we will look at some important words from the article.”
>
> “These words will appear in the reading.”

The teacher pauses, then adds:

> “We are not memorizing now.”
>
> “We are only preparing our brain so reading is easier.”

The teacher points to the first vocabulary word on the screen.

> “First, listen.”

After the audio plays, the teacher says clearly:

> “Everyone, repeat.”

After choral repetition:

> “[Student name], repeat.”

Before moving to the workbook, the teacher explains:

> “In your workbook, you will see the same words.”
>
> “If you already know the word, check ‘Know it.’”
>
> “If you do not know it, leave it empty or write Thai.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each vocabulary word**, the teacher follows **the same routine without variation**:

1. Clicks the **Play Audio** button.
2. Faces the class and gestures for choral repetition.
3. Listens carefully to pronunciation.
4. Cold calls **one student only** to repeat the word.
5. Briefly confirms meaning by:

   * pointing to the English definition, and
   * pointing to the Thai translation (already visible).
6. Moves immediately to the next word.

While students are working in the workbook, the teacher:

* Walks the room slowly.
* Looks at pages to confirm students are:

  * checking boxes, or
  * writing brief Thai notes.
* Does **not** translate orally unless the class is clearly confused.
* Does **not** ask students to make sentences.
* Does **not** stop to explain grammar.

---

## 3. What students do

For each vocabulary word, students:

* Look at the word on the screen.
* Listen to the audio pronunciation.
* Repeat the word **together** with the class.
* Repeat individually if called on.
* Look at the Thai translation to confirm meaning.
* In the workbook:

  * Check **Know it?** if the word is familiar, or
  * Leave it unchecked and optionally write a short Thai meaning or note.

Students do **not**:

* Speak out of turn.
* Ask for spelling.
* Try to memorize.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before proceeding to Step 3, the teacher checks that:

* Every word has been:

  * heard,
  * repeated chorally,
  * repeated individually by at least one student.
* Most students have marked something in the workbook for each word.
* The class remains attentive and responsive (voices audible during choral repetition).

If repetition is weak or unclear, the teacher **replays the audio once** and repeats the routine.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this routine matters:**
This step trains three habits simultaneously:

1. **Listen first** (before speaking)
2. **Speak together** (low anxiety)
3. **Notice what you already know** (metacognition)

Do not vary the routine word by word.
Consistency is what allows weaker students to participate safely.

Advanced teachers may:

* briefly exaggerate stress or intonation
* ask the class to repeat more softly or more clearly

But avoid turning this into a discussion or testing step.

> This is *preparation*, not performance.

---

If this still meets your expectation, I will proceed next with **Step 3: First Reading with Audio**, maintaining the same density and discipline.

Understood. Continuing at the **same scripted, explicit level**, with no compression and no assumed expertise.

Below is **Step 3**, written as a **true instructional script** for novice teachers.

---

# Step 3: First Reading with Audio (Listening for Overall Meaning)

---

## What teachers project on the screen:

![App interface showing the First Reading with Audio screen](app step 3.png)

The app displays the article with controls for audio playback, speed adjustment, and sentence highlighting. Students will see each sentence highlighted as the audio plays.

---

## What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page for Step 3 - Read the Article](WB 3 - Read the article.png)

Students have the article text in their workbooks with a QR code to access the interactive version. The workbook shows the same article they will hear read aloud.

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher faces the class and speaks **before touching the controls**.

> “Now we will listen to the article.”
>
> “This is the first reading.”

The teacher pauses, then gives a clear rule:

> “Do not read aloud.”
>
> “Do not stop me.”
>
> “Just listen and follow with your eyes.”

The teacher points to the screen.

> “The computer will highlight each sentence.”
>
> “Your job is to watch the words and listen.”

Before starting, the teacher adds:

> “If you do not understand everything, that is okay.”
>
> “We will read again later.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Sets the audio speed to **0.75×**.
* Confirms that **sentence highlighting is ON**.
* Places one hand on the mouse or keyboard to prevent accidental pauses.
* Starts the audio.
* Stays silent while the audio plays.
* Watches the class while listening:

  * checks that eyes are on the screen,
  * notices students who look lost or distracted.
* Does **not**:

  * translate,
  * explain vocabulary,
  * answer questions,
  * stop the audio mid-sentence.

If a technical issue occurs (audio stops or skips), the teacher:

* calmly restarts from the beginning of the sentence,
* resumes without comment.

---

## 3. What students do

* Sit facing the screen.
* Watch as each sentence is highlighted.
* Listen to the audio.
* Follow the text silently.
* Do not speak.
* Do not write.
* Do not ask questions during playback.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

When the audio finishes, the teacher checks that:

* The entire article has played from start to finish.
* Students remained silent and attentive.
* Most students were visually tracking the text.

The teacher does **not** ask comprehension questions yet.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step must stay uninterrupted:**
Many teachers instinctively stop to explain vocabulary. Doing so here weakens the purpose of the first reading.

This step is about:

* rhythm,
* flow,
* overall meaning.

Understanding **comes later**.

If students appear confused, that is expected.
Confusion at this stage means the step is working.

> First reading = exposure, not mastery.

---

When you are ready, I will continue with **Step 4: Collect Vocabulary**, written at the same level of explicitness.

Continuing. Below is **Step 4**, written at the **same scripted, explicit, novice-safe level** as Steps 1–3. I am deliberately slowing the instructional flow and describing **exact teacher behavior**, not summarizing.

---

# Step 4: Collect Vocabulary (Choosing Words to Study Later)

---

## What teachers project on screen:

![App screenshot showing the Collect Vocabulary screen](app step 4.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

After the first reading ends, the teacher addresses the class **before clicking anything**.

> “Now we will choose vocabulary.”
>
> “This is very important.”

The teacher pauses, then explains the purpose clearly:

> “We do **not** save every new word.”
>
> “We only save words that are useful to study again.”

The teacher continues:

> “When you read alone in the app, you will do this by yourself.”
>
> “Today, we practice together.”

The teacher points to the screen.

> “I will show you how to choose.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Collect Vocabulary** screen so the word list is clearly visible.
* Points to the **first word** in the list.
* Thinks aloud while pointing, saying for example:

> “I will save this word.”
>
> “I see it more than one time.”
>
> “It helps me understand the text.”

* Clicks the **save / bookmark icon** next to the word.
* Points to another word and says:

> “I will not save this one.”
>
> “It is interesting, but I do not need it now.”

* Clicks nothing for that word.

After modeling two or three words, the teacher gives the rule:

> “You must save **at least five words**.”
>
> “The lesson will not continue if you save fewer than five.”

The teacher then instructs:

> “Now you choose.”

While students are working, the teacher:

* Walks slowly around the room.
* Looks at student screens (if visible) or observes cursor movement on the projected screen.
* Answers questions quietly if a student raises a hand.
* Does **not** tell students which words to choose unless they are stuck.
* Does **not** explain grammar or usage here.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the vocabulary list on the screen.
* Decide which words are:

  * difficult,
  * important for understanding,
  * or useful in other texts.
* Click to save **at least five words** in the app.
* Open the workbook to **Step 4**.
* Write:

  * the selected words, and
  * the paragraph number where each word appears.

Students may choose **different words** from each other.

### What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page showing Step 4 - Collect Vocabulary with spaces to write selected words](WB 4 - collect vocabulary.png)

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing, the teacher checks that:

* The app shows **five or more saved words**.
* Students are not repeatedly asking “Which word?”
* Most students have written something in the workbook.

If many students have chosen randomly, the teacher pauses and says:

> “Remember, choose words you want to study again later.”

Only then does the teacher proceed.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step matters:**
This is the first moment where students are asked to **make a learning decision**, not just follow instructions.

Resist the urge to:

* correct choices,
* enforce the same words for everyone,
* overexplain meaning.

The habit you are building is:

> *“I choose what is worth my effort.”*

That habit transfers directly to independent reading later.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 5: In-Depth Reading**, maintaining the same level of explicit scripting.

Continuing. Below is **Step 5**, written at the **same fully scripted, action-by-action level** as the previous steps. This is a **deliberate shift** in the lesson, so the teacher’s language and control matter.

---

# Step 5: In-Depth Reading (Reading Again with Control and Accuracy)

---

**What teachers project:**

![App interface for Step 5 - In-Depth Reading](app step 5.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher addresses the class **before starting the second reading**.

> “We will read the article again.”
>
> “This time is different.”

The teacher explains the purpose clearly:

> “The first time, we listened for general meaning.”
>
> “This time, we read more carefully.”

The teacher gives a clear physical instruction:

> “Put your finger on the screen.”
>
> “Follow the words as we read.”

If the teacher plans to use oral reading, they add:

> “Sometimes I will stop.”
>
> “Sometimes you will read.”
>
> “Be ready.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

The teacher chooses **one structure** based on the class. The structure should be announced clearly and followed consistently.

---

### Option A: Audio + Finger Tracking (Most Classes)

* Starts the audio again (same speed or slightly faster if appropriate).
* Watches students’ hands and eyes.
* Stops the audio **only at paragraph breaks**.
* At each pause, says:

> “Stop.”
>
> “What is the main idea of this paragraph?”

* Waits briefly.
* Allows students to write before continuing.

---

### Option B: Whole-Class Round-Robin Reading

* Turns audio **off**.
* Points to the first sentence.
* Says one student’s name and gestures to read.
* After each sentence:

  * points to the next sentence,
  * calls a **different student**, without a pattern.
* Stops after each paragraph and gives the same instruction:

> “Write the main idea of this paragraph.”

---

### Option C: Small-Group Round-Robin Reading (More Regulated Classes)

* Divides the class into small groups (3–4 students).
* Says clearly:

> “Take turns reading one sentence each.”
>
> “When the paragraph finishes, stop and write.”

* Walks between groups.
* Listens for pronunciation and attention.
* Redirects quietly if groups go off task.

---

## 3. What students do

Depending on the structure chosen, students:

* Read the article **a second time**.
* Track the text with a finger while listening or reading.
* Read aloud when called on.
* Stop at paragraph breaks.
* Open the workbook to **Step 5**.
* Write **one short main idea** for each paragraph.

**What students see in their workbooks:**

![Workbook page for Step 5 - Deep Reading Notes](WB 5 - deep reading notes.png)

Students do **not**:

* Copy full sentences from the text.
* Discuss opinions.
* Ask vocabulary questions at this stage.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing to the next step, the teacher checks that:

* Each paragraph has been read carefully.
* Most students have written **something** for each paragraph.
* Students are generally identifying meaning, not copying text.

If students are copying, the teacher stops and says:

> “Do not copy.”
>
> “Use your own simple words.”

Only after this correction does the teacher continue.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step is critical:**
This is where reading shifts from *exposure* to *control*.

Finger tracking, unpredictable reader changes, and paragraph pauses all serve one purpose:

> to force attention onto meaning, not speed.

Advanced teachers may:

* increase oral reading
* reduce audio support
* ask slightly more probing main-idea prompts

But for novice teachers, the rule is:

> Slow down. Control the text. Do not rush.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 6: Collect Sentences**, written at the same level of precision.

Continuing. Below is **Step 6**, written to the **same scripted, explicit, no-shortcuts standard** as Steps 1–5. This step is especially important for modeling *how* students should study language, so the teacher’s thinking must be visible.

---

# Step 6: Collect Sentences (Noticing Useful Language in Context)

---

## What teachers project on the screen:

![App interface for Step 6: Collect Sentences](app step 6.png)

*The Collect Sentences screen shows the full article text with interactive sentences that students can select and save for later study.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher pauses the lesson and speaks **before interacting with the screen**.

> “Now we will choose sentences.”
>
> “Not all sentences.”
>
> “Only sentences that are good to study.”

The teacher clarifies the purpose:

> “When you read English, you should learn *how sentences work*, not only words.”
>
> “These sentences will help you later.”

The teacher adds an important reassurance:

> “You do not need to choose the same sentences as your classmates.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Collect Sentences** screen so the full text is visible.
* Scrolls slowly through the article.
* Stops at one sentence and points to it.
* Says aloud:

> “I am choosing this sentence.”

* Demonstrates how to **right-click / click** the sentence to show the translation.
* Reads the translation briefly.
* Explains the choice aloud, for example:

> “This sentence is useful because it shows how English explains a reason.”
>
> “I can use this sentence pattern again.”

* Clicks the **save / bookmark** icon for that sentence.

The teacher then scrolls to another sentence and says:

> “I will not choose this one.”
>
> “It is easy, and I already know it.”

The teacher does **not** save it.

After modeling two or three examples, the teacher states the requirement clearly:

> “You must save **at least five sentences** to continue.”

The teacher then says:

> “Now you choose your sentences.”

While students are choosing, the teacher:

* Walks around the room.
* Responds quietly if students ask for help.
* Encourages hesitant students by asking:

  > “Why do you think this sentence is useful?”
* Does **not** tell students which sentence to choose.
* Allows students to select **different sentences**.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look back at the article text.
* Reread sentences carefully.
* Use the translation tool when needed to confirm meaning.
* Select **at least five sentences** in the app.
* Open the workbook to **Step 6**.
* Write **two selected sentences** in the workbook.
* Check the reason for each sentence (for example: vocabulary, grammar pattern, useful phrase).

### What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page for Step 6: Collect Sentences](WB 6 - Collect Sentences.png)

*Students write two of their selected sentences and identify why each sentence is useful for learning (vocabulary, grammar pattern, or useful phrase).*

Students do **not**:

* Copy every sentence.
* Ask for grammar explanations yet.
* Translate entire paragraphs.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing, the teacher checks that:

* The app indicates **five saved sentences**.
* Students can explain, if asked, *why* they chose a sentence.
* Most students have written two sentences in the workbook.

If students appear to be choosing randomly, the teacher pauses and reminds them:

> “Choose sentences you want to use again in the future.”

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step matters:**
Many students believe learning English means memorizing isolated words. This step retrains that belief.

You are teaching students to notice:

* sentence patterns,
* how ideas connect,
* how meaning is built across words.

Advanced teachers may:

* briefly label patterns (cause–effect, description, comparison)
* ask one student to explain their choice aloud

But avoid turning this into grammar instruction.
The goal is **noticing**, not analysis.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 7: Multiple Choice Comprehension Check**, which is one of the most pedagogically sensitive steps.

Continuing. Below is **Step 7**, written at the **same fully scripted, action-by-action level**. This is a step where novice teachers often rush or “give answers,” so the script is intentionally explicit and controlled.

---

# Step 7: Comprehension Check (Multiple Choice Questions)

---

## What teachers project:

![App interface for Step 7 - Comprehension Check](app step 7.png)

*The app displays multiple-choice questions on the projected screen. Note that these questions may differ from the workbook questions, but they check the same reading comprehension.*

---

## What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page for Step 7 - Comprehension Check](WB 7 - Comprehension check.png)

*Students will answer similar comprehension questions in their workbooks after completing the class discussion.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

Before showing the questions, the teacher addresses the class clearly.

> “Now we will check our understanding.”
>
> “This is not a test.”

The teacher adds an important clarification:

> “The questions on the screen may not be the same as the workbook.”
>
> “That is okay. They check the same reading.”

The teacher gives the routine **before** the first question appears:

> “For every question, we will do the same thing.”
>
> “First, you think alone.”
>
> “Then, you talk with your partner.”
>
> “Then, we answer together.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each multiple-choice question**, the teacher follows this exact sequence:

1. **Displays the question** on the screen.
2. Reads the question aloud once, slowly.
3. Says:

> “Read quietly.”

4. Waits silently while students read the question and choices.
5. Says:

> “Turn to your partner.”

6. Watches pairs talk briefly.
7. Raises a hand and says:

> “Stop. Look at me.”

8. Says:

> “Show me your answer.”

9. Students show **fingers** (1, 2, 3, or 4).
10. The teacher scans the room and notes the most common answer.
11. **Does not click yet.**
12. Asks:

> “Why did you choose this answer?”
>
> “Where do we see it in the text?”

13. Points back to the article on the screen.
14. Invites one or two students to indicate the sentence that supports the answer.
15. Only after discussion does the teacher click the **class’s agreed answer** in the app.

If the class is divided, the teacher says:

> “Let’s check the text again.”

and briefly rereads the relevant sentence aloud before selecting.

---

## 3. What students do

For each question, students:

* Read the question silently.
* Think about the answer independently.
* Discuss their choice with a partner.
* Show their chosen answer using fingers.
* Refer back to the text to justify their answer.
* Listen to classmates’ explanations.

Students do **not**:

* Shout answers.
* Ask the teacher for the correct answer.
* Guess without checking the text.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before advancing to the next question, the teacher checks that:

* A clear class answer has been selected.
* At least one student has referred to **textual evidence**.
* Students understand *why* the chosen answer is correct (even if briefly).

After the final question, the teacher directs students to the workbook and says:

> “Now answer the questions in your workbook.”
>
> “Work quietly.”

When students finish, the teacher says:

> “Check your answers.”
>
> “Show me how many you got correct.”

Students respond using fingers.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why the teacher must not answer automatically:**
If the teacher clicks the correct answer immediately, students stop thinking and start waiting.

This routine trains three habits:

1. Think first
2. Justify with evidence
3. Accept correction through text, not authority

Advanced teachers may:

* reduce partner discussion once routines are strong
* increase text-reference demands (“Which paragraph?”)

But never remove the **evidence step**.
That is the core of this activity.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 8: Short Answer Questions**, using the same fully scripted approach.

Continuing. Below is **Step 8**, written at the **same scripted, explicit, novice-safe level** as the previous steps. This step is deliberately slower and more deliberate because it **models how students should answer and evaluate short answers in the app later**.

---

# Step 8: Short Answer Questions (Modeling How to Answer and Self-Evaluate)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

Before showing the question, the teacher addresses the class.

> “Now we will answer a short question.”
>
> “This answer is longer than multiple choice.”

The teacher adds an important clarification:

> “The question on the screen may be different from the workbook.”
>
> “That is okay. They check the same reading skill.”

The teacher then explains the process clearly:

> “First, we will answer **together**.”
>
> “I will type the class answer.”
>
> “Later, you will write your own answer in the workbook.”

---

### What teachers project on screen:

![App screenshot showing the short answer question interface with rubric criteria](app step 8.png)

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Short Answer Question** screen.
* Points to the question and reads it aloud once.
* Says:

> “Read the question again quietly.”

* Waits while students reread.

The teacher then introduces the rubric **before answering**:

* Points to the four criteria on the screen and says, one by one:

  * “Answer the question.”
  * “Use information from the article.”
  * “Give a reason or explanation.”
  * “Write in complete sentences.”

The teacher says:

> “We will try to do all four.”

---

## 3. Collaborative class answer (modeling phase)

### What the teacher says and does

1. Says:

> “Think about your answer.”

2. Waits briefly.
3. Says:

> “Turn to your partner and talk.”

4. Walks around and listens.
5. Raises a hand and says:

> “Stop. Look at me.”

6. Asks:

> “What should we say first?”

7. Elicits a short response from a student.
8. Types that idea into the app.
9. Asks:

> “What detail from the article supports this?”

10. Adds a supporting sentence.
11. Asks:

> “Do we have a reason or explanation?”

12. Adds a simple reason.
13. Reads the full answer aloud as typed.

---

## 4. Submitting and evaluating the class answer

### What the teacher does

* Clicks **Submit**.
* Displays the **model answer** provided by the app.
* Points back and forth between:

  * the class answer, and
  * the model answer.

The teacher asks the class:

> “Did we answer the question?”
> “Did we use the article?”
> “Did we give a reason?”
> “Are these complete sentences?”

For each “yes,” the teacher gestures and counts aloud.

The teacher then says:

> “Now we give ourselves stars.”

* Selects **1–5 stars** in the app based on the discussion.
* Explains briefly why that rating was chosen.

---

## 5. Individual workbook writing

### What the teacher says

> "Now you will write your own answer."

The teacher gives clear instructions:

> "Open your workbook to Step 8."
>
> "Write your own short answer."
>
> "Use the rubric to check yourself."

### What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page for Step 8 showing the short answer question and rubric checklist](WB 8 - Short answer question.png)

---

## 6. What students do

* Participate in partner discussion.
* Watch how the teacher builds the class answer.
* Observe how the rubric is applied.
* Write their **own short answer** in the workbook.
* Check the rubric boxes honestly.
* Do not copy the class answer word for word.

---

## 7. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before leaving this step, the teacher checks that:

* Students are writing, not waiting.
* Most answers include:

  * a clear response, and
  * at least one supporting idea.
* Students have engaged with the rubric.

If many students are copying, the teacher says:

> “Your answer can be different.”
>
> “That is okay.”

---

## 8. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step is done together first:**
Students often fail short answers because they do not understand what a *good answer looks like*.

By building one answer together, you are making expectations visible.

Advanced teachers may:

* reduce the length of the modeled answer
* ask students to suggest rubric scores themselves

But do not skip:

* showing the model answer, or
* discussing the rubric.

Those are what make this step transferable to independent app use.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Steps 9–10: Vocabulary Practice**, written at the same level of scripting.

Continuing. Below are **Steps 9–10**, written as **one combined scripted instructional block**, at the **same explicit, novice-safe level** as previous steps. I am intentionally over-describing teacher behavior because this is where many teachers either rush or “hand the app back to itself.”

---

# Steps 9–10: Vocabulary Practice

*(Reviewing and Strengthening Saved Vocabulary)*

> **Important orientation for the teacher:**
> In the app these are two steps, but in teaching they function as **one continuous practice cycle**. Do not treat them as separate lessons.

---

## Step 9 (App): Vocabulary Flashcards

**What teachers project for Step 9:**

![Vocabulary flashcard interface showing word with audio playback and answer reveal](app step 9.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher pauses before starting the activity and addresses the class.

> “Now we will practice the vocabulary you chose.”
>
> “These are **your words**, not my words.”

The teacher adds a key modeling statement:

> “This is exactly how you should practice vocabulary when you use the app by yourself.”

The teacher points to the flashcard interface.

> “First, listen.”
>
> “Then, say the word.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each flashcard**, the teacher follows the same routine:

1. Clicks **Play Audio**.
2. Faces the class and gestures clearly.
3. Says:

> “Everyone.”

4. Listens to the class repeat chorally.
5. Immediately says one student’s name:

> “[Student name], again.”

6. Clicks **Show Answer**.
7. Briefly points to the meaning (English and Thai).
8. Moves directly to the next card.

While doing this, the teacher:

* Keeps the pace steady.
* Does not stop to explain usage.
* Does not quiz individual students.
* Does not correct minor pronunciation errors unless they block understanding.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the flashcard on the screen.
* Listen to the audio.
* Repeat the word together.
* Repeat individually if called on.
* Mentally check whether they remembered the meaning before it appeared.

Students do **not**:

* Write during this step.
* Ask for spelling.
* Turn this into a discussion.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before advancing to the next activity, the teacher checks that:

* All saved words have been reviewed once.
* Choral repetition is audible and engaged.
* Individual students can repeat when called on.

If repetition is weak, the teacher repeats **one or two cards only**, then moves on.

---

## Step 10 (App): Vocabulary Matching Game

**What teachers project for Step 10:**

![Vocabulary matching game interface with words and definitions to match](app step 10.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher transitions explicitly.

> “Now we will play a matching game.”
>
> “This is still vocabulary practice.”

The teacher explains expectations:

> “Before we match, we say the word.”
>
> “We do not guess.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

The teacher chooses **one mode** and states it clearly.

### Option A: Whole-Class Mode

* Keeps control of the mouse.
* Points to a word and asks:

> “Which meaning matches?”

* Listens to responses.
* Clicks the class’s agreed match.
* If incorrect, says calmly:

> “That one does not match. Let’s try again.”

### Option B: Student-at-the-Board Mode

* Invites one student to come to the computer.
* Says:

> “Say the word first.”

* Allows the student to make the match.
* Confirms or redirects gently.
* Rotates students if time and management allow.

The teacher keeps the tone **low-stakes and focused**, not competitive.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the words and meanings.
* Say words aloud before matching.
* Suggest matches verbally.
* Watch corrections and adjust understanding.

Students do **not**:

* Shout answers.
* Treat mistakes as failure.
* Rush the activity.

---

## 4. Workbook follow-up (Workbook Step 9)

After both app activities, the teacher directs students clearly.

> "Now open your workbook to Step 9."

**What students see in their workbook:**

![Workbook page showing vocabulary matching and cloze exercises](WB 9 vocabulary practice.png)

### What the teacher does

* Points to the matching activity.
* Says:

> “Do this first.”

* Then points to the cloze activity.
* Says:

> “Do this next.”

* Circulates quietly while students work.
* Does not give answers immediately.

### What students do

* Complete the matching exercise.
* Complete the cloze (fill-in-the-blank) exercise.
* Work independently or quietly with a partner, as directed.

---

## 5. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before leaving this block, the teacher:

* Asks students to **check their answers**.
* Says:

> “Show me how many you got correct.”

* Observes finger responses.
* Notes common problems but does not re-teach extensively.

---

## 6. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step matters:**
This is where vocabulary moves from *recognition* to *retrieval*.

The sequence is intentional:

1. Hear → say → see meaning
2. Choose → confirm → adjust
3. Apply independently in print

Advanced teachers may:

* shorten flashcards once routines are strong
* allow faster student-led matching

But do not remove:

* choral repetition
* saying the word before matching

Those are the anchors for weaker readers.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Steps 11–12: Sentence Practice**, written at the same level of scripting and control.

Continuing. Below are **Steps 11–12**, written to the **same fully scripted, action-by-action standard**. This block mirrors the vocabulary practice but shifts the unit of attention from *words* to *sentences*, and the teacher’s modeling remains central.

---

# Steps 11–12: Sentence Practice

*(Reviewing and Practicing Selected Sentences)*

> **Orientation for the teacher:**
> As with vocabulary, these are two app steps but **one instructional block**. Students are learning *how to practice sentences independently*, not just completing an activity.

---

## Step 11 (App): Sentence Flashcards

**What teachers project for Step 11:**

![Sentence flashcards screen in the app](app step 11.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

Before starting, the teacher frames the purpose clearly.

> “Now we will practice sentences.”
>
> “These sentences come from the story.”
>
> “You chose them because they are useful.”

The teacher emphasizes transfer:

> “This is how you should practice sentences when you use the app alone.”

The teacher points to the sentence on the screen.

> “First, listen.”
>
> “Then, say the whole sentence.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each sentence flashcard**, the teacher follows this exact routine:

1. Clicks **Play Audio**.
2. Looks at the class and gestures for attention.
3. Says:

> “Everyone.”

4. Waits for **choral repetition of the full sentence**.
5. Cold calls one student by name and says:

> “Again.”

6. Listens for overall clarity (not perfection).
7. Briefly clicks or reveals the **translation**, if available.
8. Reads the translation silently or points to it without explanation.
9. Moves immediately to the next sentence.

The teacher does **not**:

* break the sentence into parts,
* explain grammar,
* ask comprehension questions here.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the sentence on the screen.
* Listen to the audio.
* Repeat the **entire sentence** together.
* Repeat individually if called on.
* Notice meaning using the translation.
* Focus on rhythm and clarity.

Students do **not**:

* shorten the sentence,
* paraphrase,
* analyze grammar.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before proceeding to Step 12, the teacher checks that:

* All saved sentences have been heard and repeated.
* Students can repeat full sentences, not just fragments.
* Attention is sustained across repetitions.

If students are mumbling or truncating sentences, the teacher repeats one model sentence and says:

> “Full sentence.”

---

## Step 12 (App): Sentence Practice Activities

**What teachers project for Step 12:**

![Sentence practice activities screen in the app](app step 12.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher transitions explicitly.

> “Now we will practice sentences in different ways.”

The teacher points to the activity options.

> “You can see there are different games.”
>
> “When you work alone, you can choose.”

The teacher sets the scope:

> “Today, we will do **one** together.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **activity selection screen**.
* Briefly names each activity while pointing:

  * “Put the words in order.”
  * “Complete the sentence.”
  * “Match sentences.”
  * “Choose the correct sentence.”
* Selects **one activity** deliberately.

During the activity, the teacher:

* Reads the sentence prompt aloud.
* Says:

> “Do not guess.”
>
> “Think about the sentence we practiced.”

* Invites students to suggest answers verbally.
* Clicks the class’s agreed response.
* If incorrect, says calmly:

> “That does not sound correct. Let’s try again.”

The teacher allows mistakes and models correction through repetition.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the sentence task on the screen.
* Recall sentence structure from flashcards.
* Suggest answers orally.
* Adjust responses based on feedback.
* Observe how sentences are repaired, not just answered.

---

## 4. Workbook follow-up (Workbook Step 10)

After the app activity, the teacher gives clear instructions.

> "Now open your workbook to Step 10."

**What students see in their workbook:**

![Workbook page for sentence practice activities](WB 10 - setntence practice.png)

### What the teacher does

* Points to **Put the Words in Order** and says:

> “Do this first.”

* Points to **Complete the Sentence** and says:

> “Do this next.”

* Circulates while students work.
* Redirects students who rush or copy.

### What students do

* Complete sentence-ordering activity.
* Complete sentence-completion activity.
* Work independently or quietly with a partner, as directed.

---

## 5. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing, the teacher:

* Asks students to check their answers.
* Says:

> “Show me how many you got correct.”

* Observes finger responses.
* Notes common sentence-pattern problems mentally.

---

## 6. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why sentence practice follows vocabulary practice:**
Students often know words but cannot *assemble meaning*. This step forces attention on order, structure, and completeness.

Advanced teachers may:

* ask students to read completed sentences aloud
* compare two sentence options briefly

But avoid turning this into grammar explanation.
The strength here is **repeated exposure + correction**, not rules.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 13: Writing Practice (Workbook Only)**, maintaining the same scripted level.

Continuing. Below is **Step 13**, written at the **same fully scripted, novice-safe level**. This step is intentionally different in nature, and the script makes that difference explicit so teachers do not try to “run it like the app.”

---

# Step 13: Writing Practice (Workbook Only – Long Answer)

> **Important framing for the teacher:**
> This step is **not led through the app**. It is a **quiet, sustained writing task** designed to prepare students for later AI-supported writing at home or in another session.

---

## What teachers project on screen:

![App interface for Step 13 - Writing Practice](app step 13.png)

*The app shows Step 13 with the title "Writing Practice" and instructions for this offline writing activity.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher stands at the front, holding the workbook or pointing to the projected image of the page.

> “Now we will write.”
>
> “This is your own writing.”

The teacher clarifies expectations immediately:

> “This is not copying.”
>
> “This is not a test.”

The teacher adds reassurance:

> “You will plan first.”
>
> “Then you will write.”

The teacher then explains level expectations carefully:

> “How much you write depends on your level.”
>
> “Follow the advice in the workbook.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Directs students to open the workbook to **Step 11: Writing Practice**.

## What students see in their workbooks:

![Workbook page - Step 11: Writing Practice](WB 11 Writing practice.png)

*The workbook page shows planning boxes (main idea, key details, vocabulary to use, reason/explanation), writing space, and a self-check list at the bottom.*

---

* Points to the **planning boxes** and names them one by one:

  * Main idea
  * Key details
  * Vocabulary to use
  * Reason / explanation
* Says:

> “Do not start writing sentences yet.”
>
> “Plan first.”

The teacher models planning briefly by:

* Writing one example word or phrase on the board (not a full sentence).
* Saying:

> “This is planning, not writing.”

The teacher then sets the writing condition:

> “You will write quietly.”
>
> “I will not correct sentences now.”

While students are writing, the teacher:

* Walks slowly around the room.
* Looks for:

  * students planning before drafting,
  * students actually writing,
  * students stuck and not starting.
* Encourages quietly:

  > “Start with your main idea.”
  > “Check your vocabulary list.”

The teacher does **not**:

* dictate sentences,
* correct grammar line by line,
* allow students to copy from the screen.

---

## 3. What students do

* Open the workbook to the writing page.
* Complete the planning boxes first.
* Write a **first draft** based on their plan.
* Use vocabulary from the lesson (at least 3 words, as indicated).
* Organize ideas into clear sentences or paragraphs, appropriate to level.
* Complete the self-check at the bottom of the page:

  * vocabulary use,
  * organization,
  * spelling check,
  * word count.

Students work **individually and quietly**.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before ending this step, the teacher checks that:

* Every student has written **something**, even if short.
* Planning boxes are completed, not skipped.
* Students have attempted the self-check honestly.

If students have written very little, the teacher says calmly:

> “This is a first draft.”
>
> “It does not need to be perfect.”

---

## 5. Connection to the app (explained, not performed)

Before moving to the next step, the teacher explains clearly:

> “Later, you will type this writing into the app.”
>
> “The app will give you feedback.”
>
> “You will improve your writing and submit again.”

The teacher emphasizes:

> “That happens **after** class, not now.”

---

## 6. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step stays offline first:**
Writing quality improves when students **think before typing**. The workbook forces planning and reflection that many students skip in digital spaces.

Advanced teachers may:

* allow peer sharing after drafting
* extend writing length at higher levels

But do not remove:

* the planning stage
* the self-check list

Those are what make the later AI feedback meaningful.

---

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 14: Language Questions (AI Chatbot)**, maintaining the same scripted standard.

Continuing. Below is **Step 14**, written to the **same fully scripted, explicit standard**. This step is sensitive because it involves AI; the script makes teacher control and sequencing unambiguous.

---

# Step 14: Language Questions (AI Chatbot – Workbook First)

> **Critical rule for this step:**
> Students **must write their questions first**.
> The AI is used **only after thinking and writing**.

---

## What teachers project:

![App interface for Step 14: Language Questions chatbot](app step 14.png)

*The AI chatbot interface that teachers use to answer student questions after they have written them in their workbooks.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher addresses the class **before opening the chatbot**.

> “Now we will ask questions about language.”
>
> “These are questions about English, not opinions.”

The teacher gives examples aloud:

> “You can ask about vocabulary.”
>
> “You can ask about sentence meaning.”
>
> “You can ask about grammar.”
>
> “You can also ask cultural questions.”

The teacher gives a concrete example:

> “For example: ‘Why is the school day in America so short?’”

Then the teacher sets a firm boundary:

> “Do **not** talk to the AI yet.”
>
> “First, you must write your question.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Directs students to open the workbook to **Step 12: Language Questions**.
* Points to the question lines on the page.

## What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page: Step 12 - Language Questions](WB 12 - Language Questions.png)

*Students write their language and cultural questions here before the teacher uses the AI chatbot.*

---

* Says:

> "Write one good question."
>
> "If you finish quickly, write a second."

While students are writing, the teacher:

* Walks the room.
* Reads questions quietly.
* Helps students rephrase unclear questions by asking:

  > “What exactly do you want to know?”
* Does **not** correct answers yet.
* Does **not** open the AI interface.

---

## 3. What students do

* Review the article and their work.
* Write one or two language or cultural questions in the workbook.
* Check spelling and clarity.
* Wait quietly after finishing.

Students do **not**:

* Call out questions.
* Use the AI themselves.
* Copy classmates’ questions.

---

## 4. Using the AI (teacher-mediated)

### What the teacher says and does

* Selects a **small number of student questions** based on time and relevance.
* Says:

> “I will type your question exactly as written.”

* Types the first student question into the AI chatbot.
* Projects the AI response.
* Reads the response aloud slowly.
* Pauses and asks:

> “What does this answer mean?”

* Paraphrases or clarifies if necessary.
* Points back to the text or earlier examples when relevant.

The teacher repeats this process for a limited number of questions.

---

## 5. What students do during AI responses

* Listen to the AI response.
* Compare it to their own understanding.
* Write short notes or summaries in the workbook.
* Ask follow-up clarification questions **only if invited**.

---

## 6. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before ending this step, the teacher checks that:

* Students understand that AI is a **support tool**, not a shortcut.
* Students see that **good questions lead to good answers**.
* The class remains focused and not overly excited by the technology.

The teacher closes the step by saying:

> “This is how you use AI to learn language.”
>
> “You think first. Then you ask.”

---

## 7. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why the workbook comes first:**
Without written questions, students treat AI as entertainment or answer-giving. Writing first slows thinking and improves question quality.

Advanced teachers may:

* group similar questions
* compare two AI answers
* revisit unanswered questions in a later lesson

But never allow:

* free AI chat
* unprepared questioning

---

## Final Step: Lesson Summary & Reflection (Workbook)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher signals closure clearly.

> “We are finishing the lesson.”

The teacher adds:

> “Now you will think about your learning.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Lesson Summary** screen briefly.
* Points to indicators such as:

  * completed steps,
  * saved vocabulary,
  * saved sentences,
  * quiz results.
* Says:

> “These show what you practiced today.”

The teacher then directs attention back to the workbook.

> "Open to the last page: Lesson Reflection."

---

## What students see for lesson reflection:

![Workbook page: Step 13 - Lesson Reflection](WB 13 - Lesson Reflection.png)

*The reflection page where students record what they learned, rate their understanding and effort, and note questions.*

---

## 3. What students do

Students complete the reflection section in the workbook:

* Write one thing they learned.
* Rate their understanding.
* Rate their effort.
* Note something interesting.
* Write one remaining question (language or cultural).

Students work quietly and individually.

---

## 4. Homework explanation (optional)

If the teacher chooses to assign homework, they say explicitly:

> “Your homework is written here.”

The teacher points to the homework section and explains which items are required.

If the school uses guardian signatures, the teacher says:

> “Ask a guardian to sign here.”

If not, the teacher says:

> “You do not need a signature.”

---

## 5. What the teacher checks before dismissal

Before ending the lesson, the teacher checks that:

* Students have completed the reflection.
* Homework expectations are clear.
* Materials are packed away.

The teacher closes with:

> “Next time, you will use the app more independently.”

---

## Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why reflection matters:**
This step trains students to connect effort, strategy, and outcome. Over time, it builds learner independence.

Advanced teachers may:

* briefly discuss reflections
* track patterns across lessons

But avoid turning reflection into discussion every time.
Its power is in **routine and honesty**, not performance.

---

This completes the **fully scripted teacher-led Reading Advantage lesson**, written for novice implementation with optional expert insight.

If you want, the next productive step would be:

* a **teacher-facing quick-reference script**, or
* a **trainer’s guide explaining why each step exists**, or
* a **Primary Advantage adaptation**.

You tell me how you’d like to proceed.

# Trainer's Guide: Implementing the Reading Advantage Teacher-Led Lesson

> **Audience:** Academic coaches, trainers, mentors, lead teachers
>
> **Purpose:** This guide explains *how to train teachers* to deliver the scripted Reading Advantage lesson with high fidelity, and *why each phase exists*. It is not shown to students.

---

## 1. Trainer Mindset: What You Are Actually Training

You are **not** training teachers to:

* cover content faster
* explain more
* improvise lessons

You **are** training teachers to:

* model disciplined reading behaviors
* follow a stable instructional routine
* resist over-teaching
* transfer responsibility gradually to students

> **Key message to trainees:**
> "This lesson works because you *do less explaining*, not more."

---

## 2. Non‑Negotiable Principles (Trainer Must Enforce)

These must be stated explicitly during training.

1. **The app is modeled, not replaced**
   Teachers demonstrate how to use it; they do not bypass steps.

2. **Workbook actions are mandatory**
   Every screen requires a physical student response.

3. **Class answers ≠ teacher answers**
   Especially in MCQ and short answer steps.

4. **AI is mediated, never free‑use**
   Workbook first, teacher selects questions.

If any of these are violated, fidelity breaks.

---

## 3. How to Train the Lesson (Recommended Training Flow)

### Step 1: Live Modeling by the Trainer

* Trainer **teaches one full step** (usually Step 7 or Step 8)
* Other teachers act as students
* Trainer narrates *why* certain choices are made

Example trainer narration:

> "Notice I didn't click the answer yet. I'm waiting for evidence."

---

### Step 2: Deconstruction

After modeling, stop and ask:

* "What did you see me *not* do?"
* "Where did I slow the class down?"
* "Where did students do more work than I did?"

Use the scripted lesson to point out:

* teacher talk vs student talk
* control vs release moments

---

### Step 3: Guided Rehearsal

* Teachers practice **one step only**
* They must follow the script closely
* Trainer interrupts if teachers:

  * explain vocabulary during Step 3
  * answer MCQs themselves
  * skip think–pair–share

Trainer language to normalize interruption:

> "I'm stopping you because this is where fidelity usually breaks."

---

## 4. Step‑by‑Step Training Focus (What Trainers Emphasize)

### Phase 1 (Steps 1–3): Discipline & Silence

Train teachers to:

* give short, clear instructions
* tolerate silence
* trust the first reading

Common failure:

> Teachers explain vocabulary during the first audio reading.

Trainer correction:

> "Confusion here is productive. Let it happen."

---

### Phase 2 (Steps 4–6): Metacognition, Not Correctness

Train teachers to:

* model thinking aloud
* avoid correcting student choices
* allow different answers

Common failure:

> Teachers tell students which words or sentences to choose.

Trainer correction:

> "You are training *decision‑making*, not accuracy."

---

### Phase 3 (Steps 7–8): Evidence Over Speed

Train teachers to:

* slow MCQs down
* demand text evidence
* build answers collaboratively

Common failure:

> Teachers click correct answers to save time.

Trainer correction:

> "Speed kills comprehension here."

---

### Phase 4 (Steps 9–12): Practice, Not Explanation

Train teachers to:

* keep practice brisk
* correct through repetition, not rules

Common failure:

> Teachers turn sentence practice into grammar lectures.

Trainer correction:

> "If you're explaining rules, the activity already failed."

---

### Phase 5 (Steps 13–14): Independence & Responsibility

Train teachers to:

* protect quiet writing time
* enforce workbook‑first AI use

Common failure:

> Teachers allow AI use before student thinking.

Trainer correction:

> "No thinking = no AI."

---

## 5. Observation Checklist for Trainers

Use this during classroom visits:

* □ Students marked interest ratings
* □ Vocabulary repeated chorally + individually
* □ First reading uninterrupted
* □ Students selected their own words/sentences
* □ MCQs followed think–pair–share
* □ Teacher entered class answers
* □ Short answer modeled before individual writing
* □ Writing included planning
* □ AI questions written before asking
* □ Reflection completed

Missing more than two items = follow‑up coaching needed.

---

## 6. Coaching Language Trainers Should Use

Avoid saying:

* "You should explain more."
* "That was too slow."

Prefer:

* "Where could students do more work?"
* "Which step did you rush?"
* "What did you model that students can now copy?"

---

## 7. Final Trainer Message

> "This lesson is not about teacher performance.
> It is about **student habits**.
> If students leave knowing *how* to read, not just *what* they read,
> the lesson succeeded."

---
