Continuing. Below are **Steps 11–12**, written to the **same fully scripted, action-by-action standard**. This block mirrors the vocabulary practice but shifts the unit of attention from *words* to *sentences*, and the teacher’s modeling remains central.

# Steps 11–12: Sentence Practice

*(Reviewing and Practicing Selected Sentences)*

> **Orientation for the teacher:**
> As with vocabulary, these are two app steps but **one instructional block**. Students are learning *how to practice sentences independently*, not just completing an activity.

---

## Step 11 (App): Sentence Flashcards

**What teachers project for Step 11:**

![Sentence flashcards screen in the app](app step 11.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

Before starting, the teacher frames the purpose clearly.

> “Now we will practice sentences.”
>
> “These sentences come from the story.”
>
> “You chose them because they are useful.”

The teacher emphasizes transfer:

> “This is how you should practice sentences when you use the app alone.”

The teacher points to the sentence on the screen.

> “First, listen.”
>
> “Then, say the whole sentence.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each sentence flashcard**, the teacher follows this exact routine:

1. Clicks **Play Audio**.
2. Looks at the class and gestures for attention.
3. Says:

> “Everyone.”

4. Waits for **choral repetition of the full sentence**.
5. Cold calls one student by name and says:

> “Again.”

6. Listens for overall clarity (not perfection).
7. Briefly clicks or reveals the **translation**, if available.
8. Reads the translation silently or points to it without explanation.
9. Moves immediately to the next sentence.

The teacher does **not**:

* break the sentence into parts,
* explain grammar,
* ask comprehension questions here.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the sentence on the screen.
* Listen to the audio.
* Repeat the **entire sentence** together.
* Repeat individually if called on.
* Notice meaning using the translation.
* Focus on rhythm and clarity.

Students do **not**:

* shorten the sentence,
* paraphrase,
* analyze grammar.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before proceeding to Step 12, the teacher checks that:

* All saved sentences have been heard and repeated.
* Students can repeat full sentences, not just fragments.
* Attention is sustained across repetitions.

If students are mumbling or truncating sentences, the teacher repeats one model sentence and says:

> “Full sentence.”

---

## Step 12 (App): Sentence Practice Activities

**What teachers project for Step 12:**

![Sentence practice activities screen in the app](app step 12.png)

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher transitions explicitly.

> “Now we will practice sentences in different ways.”

The teacher points to the activity options.

> “You can see there are different games.”
>
> “When you work alone, you can choose.”

The teacher sets the scope:

> “Today, we will do **one** together.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **activity selection screen**.
* Briefly names each activity while pointing:

  * “Put the words in order.”
  * “Complete the sentence.”
  * “Match sentences.”
  * “Choose the correct sentence.”
* Selects **one activity** deliberately.

During the activity, the teacher:

* Reads the sentence prompt aloud.
* Says:

> “Do not guess.”
>
> “Think about the sentence we practiced.”

* Invites students to suggest answers verbally.
* Clicks the class’s agreed response.
* If incorrect, says calmly:

> “That does not sound correct. Let’s try again.”

The teacher allows mistakes and models correction through repetition.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the sentence task on the screen.
* Recall sentence structure from flashcards.
* Suggest answers orally.
* Adjust responses based on feedback.
* Observe how sentences are repaired, not just answered.

---

## 4. Workbook follow-up (Workbook Step 10)

After the app activity, the teacher gives clear instructions.

> "Now open your workbook to Step 10."

**What students see in their workbook:**

![Workbook page for sentence practice activities](WB 10 - setntence practice.png)

### What the teacher does

* Points to **Put the Words in Order** and says:

> “Do this first.”

* Points to **Complete the Sentence** and says:

> “Do this next.”

* Circulates while students work.
* Redirects students who rush or copy.

### What students do

* Complete sentence-ordering activity.
* Complete sentence-completion activity.
* Work independently or quietly with a partner, as directed.

---

## 5. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing, the teacher:

* Asks students to check their answers.
* Says:

> “Show me how many you got correct.”

* Observes finger responses.
* Notes common sentence-pattern problems mentally.

---

## 6. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why sentence practice follows vocabulary practice:**
Students often know words but cannot *assemble meaning*. This step forces attention on order, structure, and completeness.

Advanced teachers may:

* ask students to read completed sentences aloud
* compare two sentence options briefly

But avoid turning this into grammar explanation.
The strength here is **repeated exposure + correction**, not rules.

If you’re ready, I will continue with **Step 13: Writing Practice (Workbook Only)**, maintaining the same scripted level.
