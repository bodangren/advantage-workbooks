# Trainer's Guide: Implementing the Reading Advantage Teacher-Led Lesson

> **Audience:** Academic coaches, trainers, mentors, lead teachers
>
> **Purpose:** This guide explains *how to train teachers* to deliver the scripted Reading Advantage lesson with high fidelity, and *why each phase exists*. It is not shown to students.

## 1. Trainer Mindset: What You Are Actually Training

You are **not** training teachers to:

* cover content faster
* explain more
* improvise lessons

You **are** training teachers to:

* model disciplined reading behaviors
* follow a stable instructional routine
* resist over-teaching
* transfer responsibility gradually to students

> **Key message to trainees:**
> "This lesson works because you *do less explaining*, not more."

---

## 2. Non‑Negotiable Principles (Trainer Must Enforce)

These must be stated explicitly during training.

1. **The app is modeled, not replaced**
   Teachers demonstrate how to use it; they do not bypass steps.

2. **Workbook actions are mandatory**
   Every screen requires a physical student response.

3. **Class answers ≠ teacher answers**
   Especially in MCQ and short answer steps.

4. **AI is mediated, never free‑use**
   Workbook first, teacher selects questions.

If any of these are violated, fidelity breaks.

---

## 3. How to Train the Lesson (Recommended Training Flow)

### Step 1: Live Modeling by the Trainer

* Trainer **teaches one full step** (usually Step 7 or Step 8)
* Other teachers act as students
* Trainer narrates *why* certain choices are made

Example trainer narration:

> "Notice I didn't click the answer yet. I'm waiting for evidence."

---

### Step 2: Deconstruction

After modeling, stop and ask:

* "What did you see me *not* do?"
* "Where did I slow the class down?"
* "Where did students do more work than I did?"

Use the scripted lesson to point out:

* teacher talk vs student talk
* control vs release moments

---

### Step 3: Guided Rehearsal

* Teachers practice **one step only**
* They must follow the script closely
* Trainer interrupts if teachers:

  * explain vocabulary during Step 3
  * answer MCQs themselves
  * skip think–pair–share

Trainer language to normalize interruption:

> "I'm stopping you because this is where fidelity usually breaks."

---

## 4. Step‑by‑Step Training Focus (What Trainers Emphasize)

### Phase 1 (Steps 1–3): Discipline & Silence

Train teachers to:

* give short, clear instructions
* tolerate silence
* trust the first reading

Common failure:

> Teachers explain vocabulary during the first audio reading.

Trainer correction:

> "Confusion here is productive. Let it happen."

---

### Phase 2 (Steps 4–6): Metacognition, Not Correctness

Train teachers to:

* model thinking aloud
* avoid correcting student choices
* allow different answers

Common failure:

> Teachers tell students which words or sentences to choose.

Trainer correction:

> "You are training *decision‑making*, not accuracy."

---

### Phase 3 (Steps 7–8): Evidence Over Speed

Train teachers to:

* slow MCQs down
* demand text evidence
* build answers collaboratively

Common failure:

> Teachers click correct answers to save time.

Trainer correction:

> "Speed kills comprehension here."

---

### Phase 4 (Steps 9–12): Practice, Not Explanation

Train teachers to:

* keep practice brisk
* correct through repetition, not rules

Common failure:

> Teachers turn sentence practice into grammar lectures.

Trainer correction:

> "If you're explaining rules, the activity already failed."

---

### Phase 5 (Steps 13–14): Independence & Responsibility

Train teachers to:

* protect quiet writing time
* enforce workbook‑first AI use

Common failure:

> Teachers allow AI use before student thinking.

Trainer correction:

> "No thinking = no AI."

---

## 5. Observation Checklist for Trainers

Use this during classroom visits:

* □ Students marked interest ratings
* □ Vocabulary repeated chorally + individually
* □ First reading uninterrupted
* □ Students selected their own words/sentences
* □ MCQs followed think–pair–share
* □ Teacher entered class answers
* □ Short answer modeled before individual writing
* □ Writing included planning
* □ AI questions written before asking
* □ Reflection completed

Missing more than two items = follow‑up coaching needed.

---

## 6. Coaching Language Trainers Should Use

Avoid saying:

* "You should explain more."
* "That was too slow."

Prefer:

* "Where could students do more work?"
* "Which step did you rush?"
* "What did you model that students can now copy?"

---

## 7. Final Trainer Message

> "This lesson is not about teacher performance.
> It is about **student habits**.
> If students leave knowing *how* to read, not just *what* they read,
> the lesson succeeded."
