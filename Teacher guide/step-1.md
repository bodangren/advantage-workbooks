Good. Starting with **Step 1** is exactly right.
Below is **Step 1 rewritten correctly**, as a **scripted lesson segment**, with **explicit teacher language and actions**, and **optional coaching notes clearly separated**.

I am deliberately **not** compressing anything. This is the level I will maintain if you approve it.

# Step 1: Introduction (Interest & Orientation)

## What teachers project on screen:

## What students see in their workbook:

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher stands where all students can see the projected screen.

> “Everyone, look at the screen.”
>
> “This is today’s article. I will read the title first.”

The teacher reads the title **slowly and clearly**, once.

> “Now, look at the picture.”
>
> “Do not read yet. Just look.”

The teacher pauses briefly to allow students to visually process the image.

> “Before we read, we always think about our interest.”
>
> “This is not a test. There is no correct answer.”

The teacher points to the star rating on the screen.

> “In your workbook, you will see the same stars.”
>
> “Please show how interested you are in this topic.”

The teacher adds:

> “You can choose one star, three stars, or five stars. Any answer is okay.”

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Introduction** screen so the title, image, and star rating are clearly visible.
* Points physically (or with cursor) to:

  * the title
  * the image
  * the star rating
* Walks slowly around the room while students are marking their stars.
* Looks down at desks to confirm students are actually writing, not waiting.
* Does **not** comment on individual choices.
* Does **not** explain the topic yet.
* Stops only when every student has marked a rating.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look at the projected title.
* Look at the image.
* Open their workbook to **Step 1**.
* Circle or mark **one interest rating** using the stars.
* Do not discuss answers with classmates.
* Do not ask content questions yet.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

The teacher visually confirms that:

* Every student has **marked one star rating** in the workbook.
* No students are still looking around or waiting for direction.
* The room is settled and focused on the task.

Only after this does the teacher continue to the next step.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this matters:**
This step is not about motivation in a general sense. It is about **training students into a routine**:
*every screen requires an action.*

Do **not**:

* ask students to explain their rating
* praise “high interest”
* joke about “low interest”

Doing so turns this into a discussion step, which it is not.

Advanced teachers may later:

* briefly reference these ratings during reflection
* notice patterns over time (without commenting publicly)

But for novice teachers, the rule is simple:

> **Interest is private. Action is required. Move on.**

---

### Stop point

This is the **baseline quality and density** I will maintain for every step if you confirm.

Please answer **one word** or a short sentence:

* “Yes, this is the level — continue.”
* or “Still too thin / too much / wrong tone — adjust like this: ___.”

Once you approve Step 1, I will proceed to **Step 2** without changing the standard.
