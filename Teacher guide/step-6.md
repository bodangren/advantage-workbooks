Continuing. Below is **Step 6**, written to the **same scripted, explicit, no-shortcuts standard** as Steps 1–5. This step is especially important for modeling *how* students should study language, so the teacher’s thinking must be visible.

# Step 6: Collect Sentences (Noticing Useful Language in Context)

---

## What teachers project on the screen:

![App interface for Step 6: Collect Sentences](app step 6.png)

*The Collect Sentences screen shows the full article text with interactive sentences that students can select and save for later study.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher pauses the lesson and speaks **before interacting with the screen**.

> “Now we will choose sentences.”
>
> “Not all sentences.”
>
> “Only sentences that are good to study.”

The teacher clarifies the purpose:

> “When you read English, you should learn *how sentences work*, not only words.”
>
> “These sentences will help you later.”

The teacher adds an important reassurance:

> “You do not need to choose the same sentences as your classmates.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

* Projects the **Collect Sentences** screen so the full text is visible.
* Scrolls slowly through the article.
* Stops at one sentence and points to it.
* Says aloud:

> “I am choosing this sentence.”

* Demonstrates how to **right-click / click** the sentence to show the translation.
* Reads the translation briefly.
* Explains the choice aloud, for example:

> “This sentence is useful because it shows how English explains a reason.”
>
> “I can use this sentence pattern again.”

* Clicks the **save / bookmark** icon for that sentence.

The teacher then scrolls to another sentence and says:

> “I will not choose this one.”
>
> “It is easy, and I already know it.”

The teacher does **not** save it.

After modeling two or three examples, the teacher states the requirement clearly:

> “You must save **at least five sentences** to continue.”

The teacher then says:

> “Now you choose your sentences.”

While students are choosing, the teacher:

* Walks around the room.
* Responds quietly if students ask for help.
* Encourages hesitant students by asking:

  > “Why do you think this sentence is useful?”
* Does **not** tell students which sentence to choose.
* Allows students to select **different sentences**.

---

## 3. What students do

* Look back at the article text.
* Reread sentences carefully.
* Use the translation tool when needed to confirm meaning.
* Select **at least five sentences** in the app.
* Open the workbook to **Step 6**.
* Write **two selected sentences** in the workbook.
* Check the reason for each sentence (for example: vocabulary, grammar pattern, useful phrase).

### What students see in their workbook:

![Workbook page for Step 6: Collect Sentences](WB 6 - Collect Sentences.png)

*Students write two of their selected sentences and identify why each sentence is useful for learning (vocabulary, grammar pattern, or useful phrase).*

Students do **not**:

* Copy every sentence.
* Ask for grammar explanations yet.
* Translate entire paragraphs.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before continuing, the teacher checks that:

* The app indicates **five saved sentences**.
* Students can explain, if asked, *why* they chose a sentence.
* Most students have written two sentences in the workbook.

If students appear to be choosing randomly, the teacher pauses and reminds them:

> “Choose sentences you want to use again in the future.”

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this step matters:**
Many students believe learning English means memorizing isolated words. This step retrains that belief.

You are teaching students to notice:

* sentence patterns,
* how ideas connect,
* how meaning is built across words.

Advanced teachers may:

* briefly label patterns (cause–effect, description, comparison)
* ask one student to explain their choice aloud

But avoid turning this into grammar instruction.
The goal is **noticing**, not analysis.
