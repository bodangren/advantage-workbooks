Understood. I will **continue at the same level**, without compression, and without assuming expertise.

Below is **Step 2**, written to the **same scripted, novice-safe standard** as Step 1.

# Step 2: Preview Vocabulary (Pronunciation, Meaning, and Attention)

---

## What teachers project on screen:

![App interface showing Preview Vocabulary phase](app step 2.png)

*The app displays vocabulary words with audio playback buttons, definitions, and progress tracking. Teachers use this projected screen to guide the class through pronunciation and meaning.*

---

## What students see in their workbooks:

![Workbook page showing key vocabulary table](WB 2 - key vocabulary.png)

*Students have a table with columns for: Word, Know it? (checkbox), Definition, and My Translation/Notes. They mark familiar words and add Thai translations or notes for new words.*

---

## 1. What the teacher says

The teacher remains at the front, facing the class and the projected screen.

> “Now we will look at some important words from the article.”
>
> “These words will appear in the reading.”

The teacher pauses, then adds:

> “We are not memorizing now.”
>
> “We are only preparing our brain so reading is easier.”

The teacher points to the first vocabulary word on the screen.

> “First, listen.”

After the audio plays, the teacher says clearly:

> “Everyone, repeat.”

After choral repetition:

> “[Student name], repeat.”

Before moving to the workbook, the teacher explains:

> “In your workbook, you will see the same words.”
>
> “If you already know the word, check ‘Know it.’”
>
> “If you do not know it, leave it empty or write Thai.”

---

## 2. What the teacher does

For **each vocabulary word**, the teacher follows **the same routine without variation**:

1. Clicks the **Play Audio** button.
2. Faces the class and gestures for choral repetition.
3. Listens carefully to pronunciation.
4. Cold calls **one student only** to repeat the word.
5. Briefly confirms meaning by:

   * pointing to the English definition, and
   * pointing to the Thai translation (already visible).
6. Moves immediately to the next word.

While students are working in the workbook, the teacher:

* Walks the room slowly.
* Looks at pages to confirm students are:

  * checking boxes, or
  * writing brief Thai notes.
* Does **not** translate orally unless the class is clearly confused.
* Does **not** ask students to make sentences.
* Does **not** stop to explain grammar.

---

## 3. What students do

For each vocabulary word, students:

* Look at the word on the screen.
* Listen to the audio pronunciation.
* Repeat the word **together** with the class.
* Repeat individually if called on.
* Look at the Thai translation to confirm meaning.
* In the workbook:

  * Check **Know it?** if the word is familiar, or
  * Leave it unchecked and optionally write a short Thai meaning or note.

Students do **not**:

* Speak out of turn.
* Ask for spelling.
* Try to memorize.

---

## 4. What the teacher checks before moving on

Before proceeding to Step 3, the teacher checks that:

* Every word has been:

  * heard,
  * repeated chorally,
  * repeated individually by at least one student.
* Most students have marked something in the workbook for each word.
* The class remains attentive and responsive (voices audible during choral repetition).

If repetition is weak or unclear, the teacher **replays the audio once** and repeats the routine.

---

## 5. Coaching note (optional – for experienced teachers)

**Why this routine matters:**
This step trains three habits simultaneously:

1. **Listen first** (before speaking)
2. **Speak together** (low anxiety)
3. **Notice what you already know** (metacognition)

Do not vary the routine word by word.
Consistency is what allows weaker students to participate safely.

Advanced teachers may:

* briefly exaggerate stress or intonation
* ask the class to repeat more softly or more clearly

But avoid turning this into a discussion or testing step.

> This is *preparation*, not performance.

If this still meets your expectation, I will proceed next with **Step 3: First Reading with Audio**, maintaining the same density and discipline.
