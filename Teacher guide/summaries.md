# Reading Advantage

## Complete Teacher-Led Lesson Plan (Highly Scaffolded)

**Lesson Type:** Teacher-Led, Projected, Workbook-Integrated

**Audience:** Secondary EFL/ESL Students (CEFR A1–C1; adjust pacing and output by level)

**Recommended Duration:** 60–90 minutes (can be shortened to ~45 minutes by omitting or compressing practice phases)

---

## Core Instructional Goal

This lesson is designed to **explicitly teach students how to use the Reading Advantage app effectively on their own** by **modeling every action** in a whole-class, teacher-led environment. The teacher does not assume prior knowledge of the app, strategies, or routines.

At every step, the teacher:

* Explains *what students are doing*
* Explains *why they are doing it*
* Models *how to do it well*

---

## Before Class: Teacher Preparation

### Teacher Must Do Before Students Arrive

1. Open Reading Advantage and load the target article.
2. Confirm:

   * Audio plays clearly through speakers
   * Sentence highlighting is functional
   * Thai interface and translations are enabled if appropriate
3. Prepare student workbooks and pens/pencils.
4. Decide in advance:

   * Which steps may be shortened if time runs low
   * Whether homework will be assigned

# PHASE 1: ORIENTATION & FIRST CONTACT WITH TEXT

## Step 1: Introduction (Interest & Orientation)

### Teacher Actions (Explicit)

1. Project the lesson start screen so **all students can see the title, image, and layout**.
2. Point to the title and read it aloud slowly.
3. Say explicitly:

   > “Before we read, we always think about our interest. This helps our brain prepare.”
4. Point to the interest stars on the screen.
5. Direct students to the workbook and say:

   > “In your workbook, find Step 1. Circle how interested you are. There is no correct answer.”
6. Walk the room to ensure **every student marks a response**.

### Student Actions

* Look at the screen
* Circle one interest rating in the workbook

### Pedagogical Purpose

* Activates background knowledge
* Establishes expectation that students respond at every step

---

## Step 2: Preview Vocabulary (Pronunciation & Meaning)

### Teacher Actions (Explicit)

1. Project the Preview Vocabulary screen.
2. Explain:

   > “These words will appear in the story. If we know them now, reading is easier.”
3. For **each word**, follow this exact routine:

   * Click **Play Audio**
   * Gesture for the class to repeat together
   * Say: “Everyone.” (choral repetition)
   * Then say one student’s name: “Again.” (cold call)
4. Briefly confirm meaning using Thai translation on screen.
5. Point to the workbook table and say:

   > “If you already know this word, check ‘Know it’. If not, leave it empty or write Thai.”

### Student Actions

* Listen

# Trainer’s Guide: Implementing the Reading Advantage Teacher-Led Lesson

> **Audience:** Academic coaches, trainers, mentors, lead teachers
>
> **Purpose:** This guide explains *how to train teachers* to deliver the scripted Reading Advantage lesson with high fidelity, and *why each phase exists*. It is not shown to students.

---

## 1. Trainer Mindset: What You Are Actually Training

You are **not** training teachers to:

* cover content faster
* explain more
* improvise lessons

You **are** training teachers to:

* model disciplined reading behaviors
* follow a stable instructional routine
* resist over-teaching
* transfer responsibility gradually to students

> **Key message to trainees:**
> “This lesson works because you *do less explaining*, not more.”

---

## 2. Non‑Negotiable Principles (Trainer Must Enforce)

These must be stated explicitly during training.

1. **The app is modeled, not replaced**
   Teachers demonstrate how to use it; they do not bypass steps.

2. **Workbook actions are mandatory**
   Every screen requires a physical student response.

3. **Class answers ≠ teacher answers**
   Especially in MCQ and short answer steps.

4. **AI is mediated, never free‑use**
   Workbook first, teacher selects questions.

If any of these are violated, fidelity breaks.

---

## 3. How to Train the Lesson (Recommended Training Flow)

### Step 1: Live Modeling by the Trainer

* Trainer **teaches one full step** (usually Step 7 or Step 8)
* Other teachers act as students
* Trainer narrates *why* certain choices are made

Example trainer narration:

> “Notice I didn’t click the answer yet. I’m waiting for evidence.”

---

### Step 2: Deconstruction

After modeling, stop and ask:

* “What did you see me *not* do?”
* “Where did I slow the class down?”
* “Where did students do more work than I did?”

Use the scripted lesson to point out:

* teacher talk vs student talk
* control vs release moments

---

### Step 3: Guided Rehearsal

* Teachers practice **one step only**
* They must follow the script closely
* Trainer interrupts if teachers:

  * explain vocabulary during Step 3
  * answer MCQs themselves
  * skip think–pair–share

Trainer language to normalize interruption:

> “I’m stopping you because this is where fidelity usually breaks.”

---

## 4. Step‑by‑Step Training Focus (What Trainers Emphasize)

### Phase 1 (Steps 1–3): Discipline & Silence

Train teachers to:

* give short, clear instructions
* tolerate silence
* trust the first reading

Common failure:

> Teachers explain vocabulary during the first audio reading.

Trainer correction:

> “Confusion here is productive. Let it happen.”

---

### Phase 2 (Steps 4–6): Metacognition, Not Correctness

Train teachers to:

* model thinking aloud
* avoid correcting student choices
* allow different answers

Common failure:

> Teachers tell students which words or sentences to choose.

Trainer correction:

> “You are training *decision‑making*, not accuracy.”

---

### Phase 3 (Steps 7–8): Evidence Over Speed

Train teachers to:

* slow MCQs down
* demand text evidence
* build answers collaboratively

Common failure:

> Teachers click correct answers to save time.

Trainer correction:

> “Speed kills comprehension here.”

---

### Phase 4 (Steps 9–12): Practice, Not Explanation

Train teachers to:

* keep practice brisk
* correct through repetition, not rules

Common failure:

> Teachers turn sentence practice into grammar lectures.

Trainer correction:

> “If you’re explaining rules, the activity already failed.”

---

### Phase 5 (Steps 13–14): Independence & Responsibility

Train teachers to:

* protect quiet writing time
* enforce workbook‑first AI use

Common failure:

> Teachers allow AI use before student thinking.

Trainer correction:

> “No thinking = no AI.”

---

## 5. Observation Checklist for Trainers

Use this during classroom visits:

* □ Students marked interest ratings
* □ Vocabulary repeated chorally + individually
* □ First reading uninterrupted
* □ Students selected their own words/sentences
* □ MCQs followed think–pair–share
* □ Teacher entered class answers
* □ Short answer modeled before individual writing
* □ Writing included planning
* □ AI questions written before asking
* □ Reflection completed

Missing more than two items = follow‑up coaching needed.

---

## 6. Coaching Language Trainers Should Use

Avoid saying:

* “You should explain more.”
* “That was too slow.”

Prefer:

* “Where could students do more work?”
* “Which step did you rush?”
* “What did you model that students can now copy?”

---

## 7. Final Trainer Message

> “This lesson is not about teacher performance.
> It is about **student habits**.
> If students leave knowing *how* to read, not just *what* they read,
> the lesson succeeded.”
