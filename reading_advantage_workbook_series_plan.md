# Reading Advantage Workbook Series: The Hero's Journey

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete plan for the Reading Advantage print workbook series, designed to complement the digital Reading Advantage extensive reading platform.

---

## Series Structure

### The Hero's Journey Theme

The workbook series uses a hero's journey metaphor that connects to the Reading Advantage jingle and creates an aspirational progression narrative:

| Series Name | CEFR Level | Tagline | Jingle Connection |
|-------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Origins** | A1 | "Your journey starts here" | "starts your journey" |
| **Quest** | A2 | "Your quest awaits" | "interactive quests" |
| **Adventure** | B1 | "Your adventure's in sight" | "your adventure's in sight" |
| **Hero** | B2 | "You're the hero in the story" | "you're the hero in the story" |
| **Legend** | C1 | "Join the legion of learners" | "join the legion of learners" |

### Hours-Based Workbook Distribution

Based on Cambridge English guided learning hours (GLH) recommendations:

| CEFR Level | Hours Required | Quarters Needed (÷25 hrs) | Workbooks |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| A1 | 100 | 4 | 4 |
| A2 | 100 | 4 | 4 |
| B1 | 200 | 8 | 8 |
| B2 | 200 | 8 | 8 |
| C1 | 200 | 8 | 8 |
| **Total** | **800** | **32** | **32** |

### Instructional Time Assumptions

- 3 periods per week × 45 minutes = 2.25 hours/week
- 9 weeks per quarter = ~27 hours per quarter
- Rounded to 25 hours to account for assessments
- 24 articles + 1 story chapter = 25 readings per workbook

## Numbering System

### Format: X.Y

- **X** = Reading Advantage Level (1-15)
- **Y** = Book number within that level (1, 2, 3, or 4)

### Examples

- **7.1** = Level 7, first book at that level
- **9.3** = Level 9, third book at that level
- **12.4** = Level 12, fourth book at that level

### Rationale

- Aligns with platform level system
- Teachers immediately know student's platform level from workbook number
- Clear progression visible at a glance

---

- **24 articles** from the Reading Advantage platform (existing, high-rated content)
- **1 story chapter** (Chapter 1 from a platform multi-chapter story)
